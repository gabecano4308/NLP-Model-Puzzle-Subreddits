But it *also* had a challenge to think of another pair of words that met the criteria. I meant to go back and look up the accompanying Wordplay writeup or think on it for a while, but now it's gone from my list of ""Recent Puzzles"" on my iPhone.

I can confirm it's *not* any of these:
05/09/2017 - rhyming phrases (SNEAKAPEEK)
06/13/2017 - phonetic spelling of initial letters in phrases (BEESTUDENT)
09/19/2017 - SILENTPARTNER (unpronounced ""partner"" letters)

I'm pretty sure it *wasn't* a Sunday puzzle, which is odd, as Mon-Sat don't usually have extra ""hints"". But I could be misremembering. I've been doing a bunch of puzzles lately.

Anyways, if anybody has an idea, I'd be much obliged. Thanks!

1,crossword,Introducing CrosswordsBackwards,"Hi Everybody,

I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Tom Verlin, a retired Southwest Airlines Captain and the creator of ""CrosswordsBackwards."" 

""CrosswordsBackwards"" provides a new and unique twist to the standard American-style crossword puzzle. What I do is create a standard 15x15 crossword puzzle and then turn it around so that ""Across"" clues have to be solved from right to left and ""Up"" clues have to be solved from bottom to top.

Having to solve the puzzle in this manner adds a new level of challenge and fun for you, the crossword solver.

We've been solving the crossword puzzle in the same manner for over 100 years now. Isn't it time to try something new? 

With ""CrosswordsBacwards,"" you'll never look at crossword puzzles the same way again!  

You can check it out a sample puzzle [here](https://crosswordsbackwards.com/). Let me know what you think.

Tom"

I also find the official websites for the free puzzles on NYT or USA Today to be rather cumbersome and unpleasant to use. What'd be ideal is something akin to Shortyz or Alphacross but for PCs; something that can just grab all of the daily/weekly crosswords in one go at the press of a button and then let me chew through them on my own time without having to worry about manually downloading everything or making a fancy script file etc.

84,crossword,Question about NYT crossword stats,"Hello!

I've been solving for about a year, and I think I'm starting to get the hang of things-- I've noticed a very marked improvement over the past couple months.

I don't really like the default NYT stats, since they show me at a 90+% solve rate, which is absolutely not correct (I assume they must count it as a ""solve"" if I give up and click ""reveal puzzle"").  That said, I compiled all my results based on what I get the ""gold congratulations"" notification without clicking reveal (i.e. I solve all by myself).  I broke this down by ""all-time"" and ""past 10 weeks"" (so I can see how I'm doing lately).

Some questions/observations:

* I would say almost a very large chunk of puzzles I don't finish (including on the weekends, which I have never completed) are because I either have 1 spot that is incorrect (perhaps due to an accidental typo, perhaps due to a misspelling).. Or I may have 2-3 spots blank where 2 clues I have no idea on intersect--- if it was just one at the end of the puzzle, I can brute force it until I find the right letter, but with 2-3 I often can't (unless I can greatly narrow down at least one to a few letters).. How do you guys get around this?  Is there a trick?  Do you ""cheat"" and look it up?  Do you still count it as solved?  I feel I am at the point where I believe I have at least a chance to solve any NYT puzzle, but I am not a genius who is immune to two intersecting clues I've never heard of
* When people post their averages here, can one assume they have a near 100% ""real solve"" rate on each day? (again, I hate how NYT calculates the solve rate; and I'm not even sure what they use for denominator for ""average"")... Or is it closer to my experience described above where a large chunk go unsolved and are not included in the average calculation
* I feel my recent Monday-Wed times seem to be in line with (at least some) people who are consistently solving Thus-Sun which is making me question if it is more common to for most ""solvers"" to be much lower than 100% (I would expect the people who are solving Thurs-Sun consistently would be sub 5:00 for the easy days)

&amp;#x200B;

\*note: I think I can currently solve Monday almost 100% of the time-- it shows 50% for recent because I gave up early on a few rather than go back and find my one letter error

1,crossword,Which is worse: overused words or obscure words?,"Amateur constructor here.  I just finished up a puzzle, but got stuck with several obscure words that I wouldn't have known without wikipedia.  So I tore the whole thing down and started over.  I managed to finish the puzzle with all well-known words, but I'm not happy with how many overused words I needed.

So, which bothers you more:

* Words that you probably wouldn't know without a dictionary
* Filling out *oleo* and *aria* for the millionth time

And for extra credit, how angry do you get at iffy abbreviations?

I'm just trying to prioritize.  Thanks!"

Twice, I've had to follow their instructions to clear up the ""data miscommunication"" to get credit for the puzzle in question and restore my streak; the third time it cleared up on its own before tech support got back to me.

I never had this issue until this summer. This summer, two things have changed with how I access the puzzle: I got a new laptop (another Macbook) and I've started using Safari as my primary browser rather than Chrome. Has anyone else had this problem, particularly more than once? Any thoughts on the cause?

Since the pandemic began, the library I work for ([Cobb County Public Library](http://www.cobbcat.org/)) has been posting a weekly mini crossword on social media to give our patrons a little something to do while libraries are closed.

The libraries have since reopened, but the feature was popular enough that we're continuing it indefinitely. Even better, we've just upgraded from a static image-per-post format on Facebook to [a Crosshare blog](https://crosshare.org/ccpl) with our whole archive in one place! We'll still be posting the link to the puzzle on social media every Saturday, but they'll be going up mid-week on Crosshare so you can get a ""sneak peek"".

These puzzles are kind of all over the place - mostly 5x5 but occasionally larger, some attempts at themes and/or bending the rules of crosswords, and all levels of difficulty in cluing and fill. In other words, there's something for everything!

Big thanks to everyone who helped me put this together: my colleagues at CCPL who gave support and test-solved, as well as u/albanyargus for creating Crosshare and giving tons of support and advice. Hopefully you enjoy Weekly Words as well!"

45,crossword,I created a new type of word-game. Is it fun? What would you change?,"Hello,

My goal was to create a new type of word-game for mobile devices.

Here's a video demo: [https://youtu.be/qd1-HokQkhA](https://youtu.be/qd1-HokQkhA)

* This is a proof-of-concept build and all the game graphics/sounds are placeholders and don't reflect the final look and feel.

**=== THE RULES ===**

1. You get five shelves to place random letter tiles
2. You cannot drag letters on shelves that won't result in a future valid word (Ex: you can drag ""B"" and then ""A"" next to it to create the first section of the word ""BALL"")
3. You can move tiles between shelves (only the first/last tiles can be moved to keep the existing word root valid)
4. You can ""tap to explode"" valid words (marked with a different color) to make room for new tiles (in order to stay alive)

**=== WIN &amp; LOSE ===**

1. When you ""tap to explode"" the target word you advance to the next level (each level will be harder than the previous one and will contain harder target words)
2. The game is lost when there's no movable tile on the screen that can create a future valid word (the game cannot continue)

**=== GAME MODES ===**

1. Practice - Create valid words until there's no valid move left
2. Time Attack - Create valid words and get as many points as you can in 90 seconds
3. Levels - Try to create the target word(s) indicated by the current level while staying alive (this is what the demo video shows)
4. PVP - Two players get the same letter tiles in the same order. The one who gets the best score in 90 seconds wins.

**=== BOOSTERS ===**

1. Bombs - they will explode entire shelves with difficult word or word-roots
2. Hints - they will suggest where to place the current letter to get the maximum points

**=== QUESTION ===**

Would you play this game? Is this new word-game concept fun? What would you change to make it more entertaining?

Thank you!"

One of my fears, especially when I'm at or near a record, is that it will be ""interrupted"" in a way that is not just failing the puzzle, which are normal and *should* end a streak. I'm talking about situations where, for whatever reason, I:

* forget to do a daily puzzle (has never happened, but I've gotten close)
* intentionally or otherwise do not have Internet for the entire solving day. For example, a power outage could end my streak if I don't have power for over a day. A reason within my control would be to go camping for a week without cell service. That trip would necessarily end my streak.
* cannot, for reasons semi within my control, do the puzzle. For example, death of a parent. I don't think I could bring myself to do a puzzle the day I get that news, or even in the days after.
* \[aspirationally\] have a puzzle published, therefore I can't ""solve"" it since I wrote it

Do you all count these against your streaks?"

You're not going to see HITLER as an answer as an extreme example.  And puzzles with rare exception include modern politics or the darker side of current events.

92,crossword,How important is setting for you all when solving. I found something interesting when I bought books of puzzles.,"I bought two big books of crosswords because I wanted to just improve my solving speed and skill in a general way. 

I complete two puzzles on my phone almost every day. I do nine puzzles a week from newspapers. 

When I got the crossword books I put one of them on my desk and the other one in the bedroom on the nightstand. 

I opened one of the books and I held it ""like a book"" and started trying to solve and my brain just never took off like normal, I did like two clues and then was like, ""fuck, I guess these ain't my puzzles"". Happened about ten times with both books, (from different publishers, Sunday editions). So, I just ignored them for a while.

Then yesterday at my desk I was having problems with my computer mouse, so I tore a crossword page out of the book to use as an experimental mousepad, it worked the mouse is just fucked and needs to be on paper or something. Then while I was waiting for software to load I grabbed a pen and looked at the crossword because why not. Boom! My solving skills seemed to return, I completed the puzzle, then I tried it with a puzzle from the other book and I solved that also.

This ever happen to you folks? 

Is my body wired different for ""holding a book"" and ""holding a piece of paper"". 

Any scientific explanation?

Without that the scheduled posts all would have the same confusing title. I like the poll idea, so once they add that I will probably try it.

Expect an automod post at 10PM (EDT) tonight for the Friday puzzle and thereafter. I found some early birds posting threads pretty soon after the puzzle releases so I'm going with the weekday release time. I can make split up the schedule and make weekend post earlier if desired (release time is 6PM EDT).

29,crossword,Another reason to have an automatic NYT post every day,"People have already mentioned the fact that it would prevent spoilers from being needed (except for the people that decide whether or not to do the crossword based on the comments, but for them we could have voting on an automod comment to give a ranking or something). Also, someone has made a post about the NYT everyday for a while now, so we might as well make it automatic. But one reason I haven’t seen mentioned yet is that if the person who makes the post has a bad take or misunderstands the theme, the post gets downvoted and people don’t get to see it. Having a bot post a discussion thread would prevent this. Are there any other reasons for or against an auto post that you guys can think of?"

I struggled a bit in the SE, where &gt;!OSSA!&lt; crosses &gt;!ESPANA!&lt;. I don't think anybody could be faulted for not knowing the first (it's pretty heavy crossword-ese), and I don't know anything about Spanish (though I could name the place in French :) ).

* View in any direction by clicking-left and drag;
* Move in any direction by clicking-right and drag.

Plenty of clever wordplay clues and not a lot of proper nouns or older cultural references, which was perfect for us young ones who also had a crush on Mia Sara in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Took me ages longer than it should've because I locked in FISHMONGER instead of FISHMARKET, but I still finished in 1:04:01 (pretty good for me for a Sunday, I'm afraid.!&lt;

For context, I am not a pro solver. I get through Mondays and Tuesdays easily but the other days are very hit or miss. I do like to get the hard stuff out of the way and reward myself with the easier solves. I started with the 1994 puzzles thinking I'd get those done with then switched to the recent ones thinking I should do those while the current events and pop culture references were fresher in my mind.

35,crossword,How do you do crossword puzzles correctly?,"I ask because I've been at this an awfully long time and can't seem to get past about 8-10 minutes on any day of the week.  In other words, I'm glacially slow, more or less.  I'm already doing the ""do puzzles"" thing, so it's not so much getting practice - as the adage goes, ""practice makes perfect"" is incorrect but more ""*perfect* practice makes perfect"".  So if you're doing it wrong, you can practice that way and still not get anywhere.

So, how do you do crossword puzzles correctly?"
36,crossword,"NYT Tuesday, July 28","I think this was a clever, original, and well-executed theme, with almost no junk fill. I can find almost nothing to fault here.

37,crossword,"Looking for info on NYT ""personal stats""","I'm relatively new to the game (started using the app on my phone around January everyday, haven't done much crosswording prior). 

I'm looking at the stats- my Monday (for example is : 5:xx best, 12:xx average)... How exactly is average calculated?  Is it all crosswords that I actually finish and get the ""congrats"" message? Does it include ones where I ask it to show the correct puzzle/mistakes/etc?  Does it include puzzles where I start and never finish or ask to reveal?  I'm well under 10 mins for the past 10 or so Monday puzzles (and previously there were many I didn't finish), so I'm curious what figures they're using.  I think the most accurate would be to only include ones I've completed correctly without hints

Also, slightly discouraging to me-- I saw another post showing that like 90% of people who attempt any given day complete it-- does this include people who ""reveal"" puzzle? I find it hard to believe that the later days in the week have such a high completion rate (even if you account for the fact that many novice people won't even attempt them-- I'm sure there's many people like me who try them and don't finish)

Thanks in advance! Tried looking online and I have found somewhat conflicting info-- I think I want to start trending how I do! (Side note is there any stats viewable for the mini beside a daily leaderboard?)"

The theme builder is in addition to all the existing tools to build layouts, edit words, and find fills.

If you've never constructed puzzles before, but are curious, there's never been an easier time to get started!

In addition to the new theme features, the site now supports having multiple active word lists, and the ability to add a collaborator to your puzzles so multiple people can work on the same puzzle.

Anyone been keeping up with the New Yorker puzzles? They come out three times per week on Monday (challenging), Wednesday (medium) and Friday (easy). 

They are all themeless and they usually feel ""cleaner"" than the NYT puzzles, though perhaps slightly harder from a speed solving perspective because there is less crosswordese. 

Anyway, I got 8:56 on this one which is pretty good for me. I enjoyed it a lot since even though there was some trivia I didn't know in it, the crosses were all fair and the letters I didn't have were very guessable."

The theme felt really fresh (and diverse! Yet totally fair!), too. It's a game I've tried to learn for some time now, but the only opportunities I have to sit down and play are ones destined to be hyper competitive (i.e. ones in which I'll barely be afforded time to think, never mind learn).  
  
Hope you guys enjoyed this one, too. Monday puzzles can often feel like going through the motions, so a pair of pleasant long answers, a decent theme, a couple connected clues (32A and 33A; 30A and 58A), and some fresh takes on some common fill (65A, 42D)...well, it makes all the difference.

1,crossword,"Questions re ""circled letters"" on NYT Mini from 9/5/2019","Hi all!

I just got into crosswords recently and have been working through some older NYT Monday puzzles and minis.  I had really been enjoying it until I hit a snag.

I completed the 9/15/2019 NYT mini and I have no idea what to do with the circled letters.

The clue is ""___-to-school (hint to this puzzle's circled letters),"" and I was able to figure out that the answer is BACK.

The circled letters are ELAY NOTE

I have stared at this for hours, tried to look this up online, and even used an anagram solver.  The best I can come up with is ""ALONE YET,"" since back to school means the parents would be alone, but that answer doesn't feel very certain, and it's definitely not satisfying.  Am I missing something?  Any help removing this brain splinter would be much appreciated.

25,crossword,The New York Times app on android sucks,"I recently subscribed to the NYT crossword thinking I'd use it with alphacross, whose settings and controls I like and am familiar with.  Unfortunately I used my google account to register, and alphacross gives me an error 403: disallowed\_useragent message when I try to login to my subscription.

OK. So I'll use the NYT crossword app.  First off it doesn't use the gboard keyboard or swiftkey or whatever, it uses its own.  That would be fine except the keyboard has horrible touch detection and I often type a word out only to find that it didn't register some of the letters.  Plus when you hit the rebus key (...), it suddenly switches to the native android keyboard for typing.  WTF.  Another thing I like about alphacross is that with the full keyboard you can hit space to switch between the horizontal and vertical clues.  And with the enter key close to the space bar I can move to the next clue quickly without having to reach up to press the arrow button.

Secondly give me some options for when I hit the backspace button.  I love how alphacross will go back and delete the letters I just filled in even if I skipped over a couple clues.  It's great because if you filled in a partially complete clue, it knows to leave the letters that were already in place (say you had ""\_l\_s"" already and you put in ""alas"", if you hit backspace twice it would only delete the 2 'a's.  Then if you hit backspace again it will go to the last letter you entered.)  The NYT app will  just delete the letters in the clue you're working on, then go back to the previous and start deleting, even if you skipped it.  It's garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant.  I even sent an email to their support team and their response was atrocious.  Told me that they knew there was a problem with the keyboard on minis (which I never mentioned) and that ""the best way to solve Crossword puzzles on your Android phone or tablet is using our Crossword app for Android."""

I also think I might try working from a standard-ish grid, whereas with this puzzle I started with the theme and then did my best to build a functional grid w/o two-letter words. That said, this was a good learning experience.

Company whose business might off without a hitch.

Anyway, this puzzle was cute, I guess, in the way you might find cute a baby of an evil, alien species. As in not a baby alien you'd want as a pet but an innocent creature you don't want to offend.

I shouldn't jinx myself but I'm finding it gets easier and easier once you learn crossword ""language"" and the common tricks. At this point it seems like when my streak does eventually end it will be because I forgot to do it and not because I got stumped on the puzzle itself.

Editorial: Last week they changed the size of the banner at the top of the page, and now I can't fit the timer and the entire puzzle on the screen at the same time. It's driving me nuts.

72,crossword,Rex Parker: ridding the world of sexism one review post at a time,"No problem with difficulty. Some problem with the fill, however. I winced at **ESKIMO KISS**, which just has this feel of ""white people cutesily describing and appropriating a meaningful Inuit greeting"" (**30D: Affectionate nose-rubbing**). Honestly, I just steer very, very clear of the word ""Eskimo"" in general. It's got a complicated history and is not \*inherently\* derogatory, but in Canada it is generally understood as pejorative and has been replaced, in official documents, by ""Inuit,"" as I understand it. The \[**Affectionate nose-rubbing**\] is a traditional Inuit greeting called a KUNIK, which seems like a word that would really, really like to be in a crossword grid. I also winced at **MAN UP**, which is just bullshit gender stereotyping of the worst variety. Any language reinforcing ""tough guy"" behavior or designed to sort the ""real men"" from the ""sissies"" can honestly \*\*\*\* off. Also, the toughest people I know are women, so the whole ""**MAN UP**!"" thing just doesn't translate for me."

89,crossword,Suggest some old favorite crosswords,"To pass time during this covid era I've been doing crosswords online over screensharing with a friend. Usually we just grab the most recent Friday/Saturday NYT, though given that we can access the entire archive of available crosswords (both NYT or from any source), this process doesn't always lead to picking the most ""fun"" or ""interesting"" crosswords. 

For example, we (mostly) solved Friday's NYT puzzle recently, didn't really enjoy it, and then afterwards found ourselves looking at Rex Parker's blog post and agreeing with his negative sentiment on it. Which led me to think: ""if I'd known this was a poorly reviewed crossword, would I have still done it, or picked another"". Of course, even if our taste exactly matched Rex Parker's (which seems unlikely), it seems like it would be difficult to get his opinion on a puzzle without reading a blog post and spoiling it. 

So I guess in general I'm wondering: a) is there some non-spoiler way of finding reviews of crosswords so that we could solve crowd-pleasers or b) if that doesn't exist, maybe you could just recommend some specific fun ones to check out. Neither of us are frequent crossword solvers, so it's very unlikely we'll have seen anything you suggest. Thanks!"

6,crossword,Is anyone else thinking of letting their NYT subscription lapse?,"I've only been following the comings and goings of the crossword world for a couple of years and it's getting harder for me personally to ignore the controversy surrounding the NYT with regards to its diversity. It seems to be coming to a head with an [open letter to the editor](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/fight-to-make-crosswords-more-inclusive/608212/) and a [recent article](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/fight-to-make-crosswords-more-inclusive/608212/) but there have been signs for a long time that the people in charge are a bit out of touch.

Coupled with this, I've discovered a great many alternatives to the point where ditching NYT would likely not really register. I usually print out a batch of crosswords from various sources (including NYT) and sort them by how interesting I find them and these days, NYT usually ends up at the bottom and I find myself trying to slog through them so I can print out a batch of more interesting ones.

Just interested in others thoughts about this. I'm in the software industry which also has a diversity problem but I feel like at least I can perhaps make a small difference here with my wallet.

For the record, here is how I rank my current subscriptions:

* Matt Gaffney
* Evan Birnholz
* AVCX
* Elizabeth Gorski
* Inkubator
* NYT

I often sprinkle in some USA Todays, BEQs, and New Yorkers as well but the UIs for these ones aren't great for printing (compared to the others, except NYT, which are delivered to my email) but I would reach for them over NYT these days as well."

16,crossword,Any other Twitch streamers on here?,"Hi! So with all my newfound downtime, I decided to start twitch streaming my daily crossword solving! Solving along with viewers has actually been such a nice way to maintain some sense of togetherness and regularity in my otherwise amorphous day-to-day, and I’ve even made some new friends which is awesome! 

I was wondering if anyone else on this subreddit twitch streams as well? Or knows of any other crossword streamers? I don’t know of many, and would love to start cross pollinating! 

If you want to check out my stream, I’ll be live at 6pm EST today, and I try to go on at that time every single day!

That's a few thousand people who might be paying for a subscription to the daily puzzle who woke up today to find a puzzle that was previously published. This is just a horrible decision. Could the NYT really not find an original puzzle to run in their paper? I find it absolutely ridiculous."

was postponed on account of the coronavirus pandemic, two
crossword enthusiasts, Kevin Der and Finn Vigeland, quickly set
up an online event to take its place. Nearly 2,000 people took
part from home. This is the final puzzle. The tournament's other
puzzles remain available online (look for ""Crossword

69,crossword,Side On: Metapuzzle - XC," [http://crossword.info/XC009/Meta\_Side\_On](http://crossword.info/XC009/Meta_Side_On)  (link)

Hello again! Another crossword today. I was going to post sooner but with the spate of crosswords on Saturday I thought I would give it a day or two.

This is another metapuzzle, an easier one than the last one. If you haven't done a metapuzzle before, it is just a crossword puzzle with an extra word or phrase you have to find once you have solved it. I've put some hints on how to solve it as well as the solution below. 

Hint 1: &gt;!What do the four longest answers in this crossword have in common?!&lt;

Hint 2: &gt;!What goes next in the pattern? Look for a suitable phrase that fits based on the description.!&lt;

Solution: &gt;!The the last word in each of the four answers has a new side added on.!&lt; &gt;!The next shape in the order is a five-sided shape, which is a pentagon.!&lt; &gt;!THE PENTAGON is a famous headquarters.!&lt;"

What the hell does this mean? When has a meteor been used in this context ever?"
72,crossword,"NYT Sunday April 5, 2020","43A: ""Busy Bee, for short""
Answer: &gt;!SAM!&lt; ???"
73,crossword,Question/issue with NYT bonus April puzzle,"I think 46D in the NYT's April bonus puzzle is incorrect. The theme is National Day of Pink. The clue in question (for a 3-letter word) reads: ""____ salt (condiment that may be pink)."" The puzzle's answer, along with my question, is below.

&gt;!The answer is ""SEA."" Looking it up on the internet, *Himalayan* salt is pink...but it's not the same as ""sea salt."" I'm not sure that I've ever seen pink sea salt.!&lt;

Seeing as how we're all trying to find ways to pass the time, here's one I threw together relatively quickly.  I didn't spend as much time as usual when coming up with the clues since puzzle is already a bit late to the party.  There's a bit of a slant to how some of the clues are written, which might be relevant depending on how you've been staying busy for the last few weeks.  There's another bit of a slant on some other clues that apply more towards current events.  But just about all of the answers are quite fair and there should be enough normal clues to make this a pretty quick solve.  And the theme isn't so much a theme, but just a loose association of some recent feelings."

I tried to tweak it a bit today taking into account some of your thoughts on the last one. I like this one a bit more; I think its a better fill with less short, crosswordy answers. Still had to use some, but tried to think of more creative clues with them.  

About the puzzle: I was pretty excited about the theme when I thought of it but struggled putting the idea into action. In addition, it makes use of circles and I wasn't sure what the general ""guidelines"" of that are. Mine ended up not having circle symmetry and I think that may be a no-go.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A Puzzling Experience**

Hustling towards the entrance of the Stamford Marriott on a blustery March evening, I’m questioning my life choices. I’ve just driven two hours through the dark, Connecticut gloom, after a full work week, to arrive at my destination: The American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. For the 42nd year in a row, Will Shortz, editor of the industry-standard *New York Times* crossword, has gathered a bunch of puzzlers like myself to nerd out about word games. So here I am, pencil in hand, ready to meet my crossword destiny. What have I gotten myself into?

I have low expectations: I pretty much just don’t want to embarrass myself. But this is a big tournament and I’m weirdly nervous. There are 741 entrants this year, including 218 “rookies” – people like me who’ve never participated. I’ve been puzzling for years and, by *nearly* any measure, I’m very good at crosswords. But this is a group of seriously smart smarties, whose first crossword rodeo this is not.

The competition is stiff, even though very few of us have a chance to win. Mostly we’re here to indulge in a favorite hobby and meet like-minded people on a fun weekend vacay. But competition is a funny thing; it makes people...competitive. I’m a strong puzzler but I’ve never had a bar with which to compare my ability… Maybe I’m like, *really* good? 

Friday night’s festivities aren’t part of the competition, but more of a welcome reception. We do a few puzzles, have some wine and cheese. Real classy-like. And the thing that surprises me most is the non-dorkiness of it all. The Marriott ballroom is filled with completely normal-ish people like myself who just really enjoy crosswords. Friday evening is fun, casual and low-pressure. Nice time.  

Saturday, however, is neither casual nor low-pressure. And I’m not sure if “fun” is the right word either. When *you* think of doing a crossword you might imagine a serene experience, possibly while enjoying a robust cup of coffee, maybe in front of a cozy fire on a crisp winter’s morn. But this is not that. This is *crosswar*. You’re fixated on a huge clock with massive red numbers ticking away towards the impending doom of an incomplete puzzle, clutching your pencil like a truck driver white-knuckling through a hail storm. 

We do six puzzles and the whole day is a blur. After the first three I’m feeling pretty confident - I’ve only made one total error - until I realize I’m puzzling *way* too slow. I finish Puzzle #1 in about 8 minutes but half of the room has already cleared out, having finished before me. Yikes.

The fleeting confidence I once felt is flattened by the steamroller known as Puzzle #4. It has a weird quirk (it’s a[ rebus](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html) puzzle, for my fellow crossnerds) that I fail to crack in our allotted 20 minutes. Classic Thursday puzzle. I finish with 27 times as many errors as the first 3 puzzles combined (so, 27 errors). Morale is low. Fade to black.

That was surely the last nail in my tournament coffin, but now Shortz takes the stage and announces that Puzzle #5 is “the hard one.” I slog through it and manage to finish, albeit with a bunch of errors. Puzzle #6 feels like a gentle summer breeze after the last two. We wrap for the day and I head straight to the bar for some consolation whiskey, mentally and emotionally exhausted.

Indulge me for a moment, while I describe the physical demands of this tournament - Yes, I’m going to whine about the aches and pains of sitting in a chair doing a crossword puzzle. First, let’s talk about pencils; like many puzzlers I’ve become spoiled by apps and online puzzling. Pencil and paper take some getting used to. Manual rigor mortis quickly sets in, so after one puzzle you’re cruising swiftly down Carpal Tunnel Avenue, with your focus in tow. Then, you find your neck semi-permanently cocked at an unnatural angle only known to puzzlers. Plus, when you erase something, the whole table shakes and everyone knows you’re moving backwards…*shame*! Finishing a puzzle is doubly satisfying because you finally get to stand up.

Sunday we’re back at the Marriott for the finals – one puzzle to decide it all. By this time, we know where we stand and which competitors have an actual shot to win the thing. I am not one of those people. Before the tournament, I’d set a goal for myself to finish in the top half of the field, but by now it’s clear that isn’t happening. I’m ranked #530/741 and really just want to finish in the top 500 at this point. A totally arbitrary goal, but whatever, something to strive for.  

Today’s puzzle isn’t especially tough, but I’m all out of brain cells after yesterday’s marathon. Luckily, I’m in no rush, having accepted my fate as an also-ran. My relaxed approach and well-rested pencil wrist lead to my best score of the whole weekend, and I catapult myself up the rankings all the way to #515. Not spectacular, but I’m glad to have finished strong. Ultimately, the trophy goes to Dan Feyer, marking his 8th victory at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament.  

**Lessons Learned:**

In the end, I’m really happy I put myself through the gauntlet, spending hundreds of dollars and several days of my life to learn that I’m not all that good at crosswords. It’s aspirational, and encourages me that puzzling won’t get boring anytime soon. Now that I’ve witnessed grid-greatness in the flesh, I’m hooked, and it inspires me to elevate my own grid-game. I’ll be back in Stamford this March for the 43rd annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and this year I’ve got Dan Feyer in my sights - well, I know what he looks like, anyway."

Is there a pattern that I'm missing? It's kinda sequential but it's not. Excel has a system for converting dates to numbers, but that's not the system the NYT is using here. It's weird. The easy answer is to print out the newspaper version because it goes by the date, but I don't like the way it looks and beyond that, this is bugging me and I want to figure it out.

16,crossword,"(WARNING: entire post is one big SPOILER!) u/DanAvidansThumbs Does the NYT Puzzle: Friday, Jan. 31, 2020","Hi! First-time poster here, but I’ve been lurking for a couple of days. I’ve always wanted to write about my daily experiences with the New York Times crossword, but I’ve always felt that I lacked the panache and solving acumen (not to mention hilarious curmudgeonly personality) of, say, Rex Parker. Today, however, I’ve got some spare time at work and a completed puzzle before me, so here goes nothing.

A little about me: I started doing NYT puzzles (unknowingly, since they were syndicated in my local paper) around age 16 or so on a lark. I stopped after high school as a sometimes-Wednesday-level solver but started again when I was introduced to the app in about 2016. Soon I was tackling Saturdays. My girlfriend started doing them too. We talked of going to the ACPT one day and she made that happen for us in 2018. I loved it!

Fri, 1/31/20

Constructor(s):  John Guzzetta, Michael Hawkins

Difficulty: Easy (7:57)

Sometimes you sit down, start making your way fruitlessly through the clues, and realize, as the completely virgin grid stares back at you, that this is going to be a slog.

Today was not one of those days.

I ventured a guess of PENDULUM for 14A (“Aid in hypnotism”), followed it up with REI two rows below (18A: “Big gear retailer”), and confirmed those guesses by getting 1-, 2-, and 3-Down from the crosses. The northwest corner then was filled quickly, and trellised down via AUCTIONEER (5D: “One with lots to sell”) and most of the west fell in short order.

The southwest proved to be beyond my capabilities at that point, so I shifted my focus elsewhere. With FAK— in place I managed to get FAKIR, a word I somehow dug up from the “Prince Ali” song in the non-Will Smith *Aladdin*: “...with his forty FAKIRs, his cooks and bakers, his birds that warble on keyyy!!!...” (33A: “Muslim ascetic”). That in turn helped me change IMfine to IMOKAY (20D: “Assurance after an accident”) and led to EMoRY, quickly corrected to EMERY (am I the only one who can’t keep those straight??) (40A: “____ board”).

Like a Quidditch player taking a nosedive for the Golden Snitch, GRYFFINDOR (28D: “Potter’s house”) swooped down into the southeast, which provided little resistance but lots of delight. Including such contemporary answers as UNFOLLOW (61A: “Spurn on social media”) is less a BOLD MOVE than an attempt to keep the NYT puzzles current and relevant, but this younger solver appreciates the nods anyway (58A: “Bit of derring-do”).

With the rest filled in, it was time to return to the southeast. Rex the baseball lover would be mortified to know I had WILD— and could not suss out WILD PITCH (32D: “Temptation to steal”). So many of the puzzle’s other clues were so literal and non-wordplay-ish that I was racking my brain for some form of kleptomania that started with WILD. But somehow the rest of the crosses fell into place one by one, until it *had* to be WILD PITCH which I dutifully filled in and felt immensely stupid for not getting sooner.

All in all, this was an EASY WIN (15D: “Romp”). I chalk it up to the frequent literal clues. Take 1-A (“Hot sauce”), for instance. I thought for sure it would be a word for giving someone SASS (29-D: “Some freshness”), or a flaming alcoholic beverage, maybe? No. It was literally a hot sauce, SRIRACHA. There were also some plump softballs like 8-D (“‘Of thee I sing’ addressee” = AMERICA) and the Maleska-era standby clue “Ne plus ultra” for ACME at 30-D.

Finally, the “I’ve had my fill of this fill” award today goes to 46A (“Hosp. figure”). LPN? Fine, it’s a recognized acronym, at least according to Google, but it just looks like a random splash of alphabet soup in an otherwise fine puzzle to me.

Thoughts, everybody?

40,crossword,Creating Wordplay/Puns,"I've been making a few crosswords lately and I really like puzzles with clever puns (the ? clues). I want to implement some of my own but don't really know how to come up with any. Is there a certain way to go thinking about it? So far I am just taking common phrases and seeing what they could be, for example: spare parts? = pins."
41,crossword,Notes on solving the 01/19/20 New York Times acrostic puzzle,"I knew three right away: “C. Singer with the 1990s hits ‘Stay’ and ‘I Do’ (2 wds.)” (8 letters) is LISALOEB, “E. Creator of Aslan and the world of Narnia (3 wds.)” (7 letters) is CSLEWIS (was it really necessary to mention Aslan in that clue?), and “N. Shoe company named after an antelope” (6 letters) is REEBOK. Also, although I have never heard the term before, I am going to guess, based on the shape, that “T. What a Texas hold ‘em player might call ‘candy canes’” (6 letters) is SEVENS.  
  
Word 25-28 is W - E N, WHEN, which doesn’t help much (it makes the first letter of “K. Participants in an annual puzzle event at M.I.T.” (7 letters) be H, but I am going to resist filling in “hackers” because I don’t consider a hackathon to be a puzzle event). Word 48-53, meanwhile, is - C - - S S which I think is “access” or “across”; the third letter is the last letter in “Q. Thataway, in yon direction” (7 letters) which I sort of suspected (after a few eyerolls) was THITHER, so we’ll fill that in and ACROSS also. This makes the fourth letter in “A. Alternate title for ‘Mbube’, also its refrain” (7 letters) be an O, which knocks out my wild guess of “Kumbaya”, oh well.  
  
The first word 1-3 is - - E, almost certainly THE; this makes “O. Canine pair” (8 letters) end in H, so we’ll fill in TEETH at the end (word 91-92 fills in as IT, nice). This in turn makes word 167-169 be - - E, so also THE, it follows T - and - - V E, so that first word is TO (and the fourth letter in “K. Participants in an annual puzzle event at M.I.T.” is now T, contraindicating “hackers”, my faith in C&amp;R may be restored).  
  
“O. Canine pair” (8 letters, - - - T E E T H) might be EYETEETH, in particular this makes word 152-154 be - - E, which is encouraging in a THE-heavy grid, and also makes word 125-133 be - E - I O - S - Y. That first letter at 125 comes right before the H in “L. Huge Namibian national park and game reserve” (6 letters, - - - - H -) and the third letter is the second-to-last one in “K. Participants in an annual puzzle event at M.I.T.” (7 letters, H - - T - - -) which is very likely to be an R…my point being that word 125-133 looks like SERIOUSLY and not “deviously” or whatever.  
  
That L makes “H. Stuck firmly in place” (7 letters) be - L - - - - - which looks like PLANTED (word 106-109 now T A K -, TAKE, that’s good; word 10-11 now T -, TO, that’s also good), and “F. End result, final outcome” (6 letters) be U - - - - - which looks like UPSHOT. Also word 29-32 after WHEN is - H - -, so the first letter is a T, which reveals “U. Deep and rasping, as a growl” (7 letters, - - - O - T -) as THROATY.  
  
Word 70-76 is - P P E - R S which is APPEARS. More significantly, the puzzle, starting at 148, is T - - Y, - - E, - - - - L -, TO, - - V E, THE, - - - -, L - - - - which I think is THEY ARE LIABLE TO HAVE THE LAST LAUGH. This creates a problem in “J. Seeming to make sense, though unproven” (9 letters, - H B - - - - - -), and “S. Place attended by aspirants to some degree” (10 letters, U - - - - - - - - E) looks like UNIVERSITY so what’s up with that final E…luckily both of these are resolved by changing LIABLE to LIKELY, giving us UNIVERSITY and a more reasonable H E pair in answer J.  
  
That flurry of letters doesn’t open up as much as I had hoped, although “B. Make one’s way around a chain, say (hyph.)” (9 letters, I S - A - - - - -) must be ISLANDHOP and “P. Job requirement for most actors” (8 letters, - - - - T - O -) apparently is AUDITION. The grid is still not opening up much, although word 95-103 - - - - - - - L T, after IT and IS and leading into TO, TAKE, [something], [something], SERIOUSLY feels like DIFFICULT.  
  
“I. Comedy bash, hoot and a half” (7 letters, - U K - - - -) must be (oog) YUKFEST, and “X. Oblique line; biased” (8 letters, D - - - - - A L) must be DIAGONAL, although I was hoping for a more-different-than-“oblique-line” meaning of “biased”.  
  
OK, what do we have now…starting at 25 we have WHEN, T H - Y, - R -, - - - N, B O - - D - N G, ACROSS, - H E - -, - A - I V -, H - A T H before APPEARS, then later we have, after IT IS DIFFICULT, TO, TAKE, - O U N - - - -, - N - - A L S, SERIOUSLY, B - -, - F, - - -, D - E S N - T leading into THEY ARE LIKELY. Assuming that B O - - D - N G and - O U N - - - - are the same word that word would be BOUNDING, so we have WHEN THEY ARE SEEN BOUNDING ACROSS THEIR NATIVE HEATH and then TO TAKE BOUNDING ANIMALS SERIOUSLY BUT IF ONE DOESNT.  
  
This fully fills in “V. Genre that combines fuji music and highlife with American funk and jazz” (8 letters) as AFROBEAT (that definition appears to be pulled verbatim from Wikipedia FWIW). Also we can see that “D. Paper flier” (7 letters, L E A F - E T) is LEAFLET, “J. Seeming to make sense, though unproven” (9 letters, T H E - - E T I C) is THEORETIC, “M. Partially caught up to (2 wds.)” (8 letter, G A I N E - - N) is GAINEDON, and “R. Chums, mates, pals” (7 letters, - U - D I E S) is BUDDIES. Also “K. Participants in an annual puzzle event at M.I.T.” (7 letters) is now H U N T E R - so I guess it is HUNTERS, which is somewhat lame…I mean I guess it is a “Puzzle Hunt” but is it too late to request “hackers” instead?  
  
We have four clues left: “A. Alternate title for ‘Mbube’, also its refrain” (7 letters, - I M O - E H), “G. Arrangement involving every character” (7 letters, - A N G R A -), “L. Huge Namibian national park and game reserve” (6 letters, N A T oops sorry I meant E - O S H A), and “W. Reaction to cat dander, for some” (8 letters, - H I N I - I -). I mean I could guess at three of the four, but we’ll go to the grid instead.  
  
After THE at the start we have D E S I - E, TO, R O - P, - I - H, L I O N -, and then after APPEARS starting at 77 we have - O, BE, - I D E S - R E A D leading into IT IS DIFFICULT. It’s DESIRE TO ROMP WITH LIONS and TO BE WIDESPREAD, so the answers are WIMOWEH, PANGRAM, ETOSHA, and RHINITIS.  
  
The author is *wait just a moment* WTF is “Wimoweh”?!?!? Is that supposed to be the “lion sleeps tonight” song? Oh geez it is…well who knew?? Not me apparently. An-d-yway, the authors is WILL CUPPY and the book is THE GREAT BUSTARD (which is a bird, it turns out, just to add to the general confusion). After one final mental “harrumph”, we are done."

This crossword is a metapuzzle, which if you never done one before can be a bit confusing. Basically, the answer can be found in the puzzle itself with a bit of wordplay involved, and with the puzzle's title as a hint. A couple hints on how to solve it as well as the solution are below. I wrote this for Christmas but forgot to post it. Enjoy!

Hint 1: &gt;!Look for the names of trees hidden in the puzzle.!&lt;

Hint 2: &gt;!There are five trees hidden horizontally. Once you have found them, try looking where the title suggest you look.!&lt;

Solution (Spoiler Warning): &gt;!There are five trees names horizontally hidden in the grid, OAK, FIR, ELM, ASH and PINE.!&lt; &gt;!The letters below them from left-to-right, top-to-bottom spell ""Christmas Present"" which is something that can be found under the tree.!&lt;"

I have found a lot of resources online from NYT and others with advice on how to get past beginner level solving and how to solve if you’ve never solved before, but I’m interested in resources for getting better at the harder puzzles/getting to the point where I could maintain a streak for longer than a week or two (I think the longest I’ve gone is about 2 weeks, but I use my parents’ nyt subscription so if they check, it messes up my streak, making it hard to know for sure). I’ve tried doing packs/archives of Wednesday/Thursday puzzles, and harder ones, but a lot of the time the older puzzles seem harder because they are of a different cultural moment.

Any advice would be appreciated :)"

73,crossword,Notes on solving the 01/05/20 New York Times acrostic puzzle,"I only new two right away: “P. Went from park to reverse, e.g.” (7 letters) is SHIFTED, and “U. Billy Joel song about a show-off (2 wds.)” (7 letters) is BIGSHOT. Not much to work with so let’s start angling.  
  
The first word is a single letter, I or A; at the start of a quote the I is more likely, especially since single-letter word 97 is already I so there is some first-person narrative here. This makes “I. Forte of a rapper” (7 letters) be - - - - I - -, so an ING ending; looking at the rest of the letters, the third one is the second letter in the two-letter word 105-106, and the fourth one is the first letter in the two-letter word 84-85, so I will go with RHYMING which also fits the “slightly hipper parents” vibe of typical C&amp;R clues. It also makes word 11-18 end in G and word 144-151 end in I N -, which both look like ING endings also which is good since parts of speech tend to reappear in quotes.  
  
If we fill in those ING endings, then “C. Without uniform distribution” (8 letters) is - - - - - N - -, so I’ll go with UNEVENLY which was almost my third answer right off the bat. All those letters land incredibly uneventfully in the grid, with slight positive signs from word 32-33 now also being - Y, and word 111-112 and 113-115 being - N, - H - which is likely “on the” or “in the”. THE looks solid in any case so we’ll fill that in, this makes “D. Hot spot in global politics” (7 letters) end in T, let’s try MIDEAST there. Again an unevenfill fill; word 2-8, right after I, ends in E - so that last letter is almost certainly D. This makes “T. Active, forceful, peppy, vigorous” (7 letters) start with D, which looks like DYNAMIC (long word 86-96 now ends in Y, word 129-130 is ON, word 32-33 is MY).  
  
Word 84-85 is M - following word 82-83 - F, so given the amount of first-person in this quote that should be “on my” or “in my”, so we’ll fill in MY. This lands a Y in the middle of “K. Bitter alkaloid obtained from nux vomica” (10 letters, - - - Y - - - I - -) which is a bit daunting until I think of STRYCHNINE—which apparently really does have 10 letters. At this point not getting any major conflicts in the fill is likely proof enough, and having a nice fit like word 98-104 now starting with C H is a bonus.  
  
“J. When the Lydians began minting coins (2 wds.)” (7 letters) ends in E, which makes me think the second word is AGE, and the only one I can think of that fits is IRON. This makes word 64-72 be G E E - I N - - - which I guess must be GEEKINESS; I like that it makes the last letter of “S. Shrub named for its numerous peeling exterior layers” (8 letters) end in K since that would fit with BARK. It also makes “V. California export” (7 letters) end in S, which makes sense because “W. Animals that are an anagram of Answer V.” (7 letters) must presumably be a plural, thus V must also have an S in it (although not necessarily at the end).  
  
After GEEKISHNESS we have - -, C - -, - - - -, - F, MY, - E - S - - - - - - Y which I think ends OF MY PERSONALITY, and then after that we have I, C H - - G - -, - Y, - - N -, - N, THE, - A -, - which looks like I CHANGED MY MIND ON THE DAY I. Continuing with this theme of life choices, the start of the puzzle I, D - - - - E D, O -, B - - - - I N G, A feels like I DECIDED ON BECOMING. This makes “F Small amount; person who’s difficult to control” (7 letters) be - - - D N - L, which is likely wrong (the N in particular, from that last ON), but let’s ignore that for now.  
  
This reveals annoyingly little about the answers. “I. Heaviest of the heavy metals” (6 letters, O - M - - -) must be OSMIUM, and “N. Poet who wrote ‘Earth laughs in flowers’” (7 letters, - M E - - O -) must be EMERSON. And for “L. Unit of magnetic field strength named for a Danish physicist” (7 letters, - E R S - - D), the name OERSTED bubbles up from some far corner of my brain. Oh, and I guess (gak) “E. Thumbthing to do?” (7 letters, - - I - D - -) is TWIDDLE.  
  
I think what the author decided on becoming was a - - - M - S T, W - - - H, MY which is CHEMIST WHICH MY, but filling that in gives you “H. Breach of trust; faithlessness” (7 letters) as P - E - - I - Y and I now think that is PERFIDY, so that E is wrong…I see, it is not “decided on” but DREAMED OF starting at letter 2.  
  
The author/title starting at clue E is T - E P O I S O N E R S so the first letter in “F. Small amount; person who’s difficult to control” (7 letters) is now H - - D F - L (the concerning N changing to an F in the on/OF swap above), which of course is HANDFUL. And “G. Surround with arms” (7 letters), now E M - - - C - instead of E D - - - - - is EMBRACE. Furthermore “R. Pieces at global competitions (7 letters, A - - H - M -), relieved of its initial I, is ANTHEMS.  
  
The last two words starting at 163 are B U - S - N and B U - N - R which given the chemist angle are BUNSEN BURNER. Looking at “V. California export” (7 letters, O R - - - E S) and “W. Animals that are an anagram of Answer V.” (7 letters, - N A - E - -), since the two are anagrams we know six of the seven letters for both and it must be ORANGES and ONAGERS.  
  
There are six answers remaining, some quite bare: “A. European region associated with an artsy lifestyle” (7 letters, - O - - - - A), “B. But of good fortune for a gambler (2 wds.)” (8 letters, - - - - - - I T), “M. Water pipe with a Persian name” (8 letters, N A - G - - - E), “Q. Iconoclastic dissident” (7 letters, H E - - - I C), “S Shrub name for its numerous peeling exterior layers” (8 letters, - I N - B A R K), and “X. Hot spot domestically” (7 letters, - - - C - - -).  
  
I can see at least one of those (and a couple more I have zero idea about), and I’m sure that second “Hot spot” clue is using it in a different sense than the first one, but I can get everything from the grid. After WHICH we have MY, - - - - D R E N, A S S U R -, ME, R - V E A L S, - - E, T - - E, GEEKINESS, AT, - - E, C O - - leading into OF MY PERSONALITY, and then the author changed their mind on the day they S - T, - -, H A - R, ON, F - R E, T - I - -, LONG, D A N G - I N G, - R A I D S, T H I - - leading into BUNSEN BURNER.  
  
That is MY CHILDREN ASSURE ME REVEALS THE TRUE GEEKINESS AT THE CORE and then SET MY HAIR ON FIRE THINK LONG DANGLING BRAIDS THINK. The answers are then revealed to be BOHEMIA, LUCKYHIT (!), NARGHILE (!!!), HERETIC, NINEBARK (!!), and KITCHEN. The author is BLUM, the title is THEPOISONERSHANDBOOK, a narghile is apparently some sort of hookah, and we are done."

I just got an iPad for Christmas, and I got a cool keyboard case called Brydge for it, which more or less makes it a mini touch-screen laptop. I have been doing the crossword on the iPad since I got it, and it’s a lot of fun with the new keyboard, except for one issue. Whenever there are two of the same letter in a row, there seems to be some sort of sticky keys type feature that makes me wait almost a full second between each instance of the same letter. This makes entry frustrating and slow, as there are obviously lots of instances of repeated letters in any given puzzle. I have tried on other apps, and it seems only to be an issue in the NYT crossword app. I’ll reach out to their support, but I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or if anyone knows how to fix this issue.

Thanks, and looking forward to being a part of this community.

Actually, fearing that I wasn't intellectually capable quite yet, I first practiced with a few of the Monday puzzles. They were surprisingly easy, so I decided to just jump into today's puzzle.   
It took me a few hours. I did my best not to look up the answers but eventually had no choice. Nevertheless, I don't remember the last time I felt so accomplished. These puzzles are fun, relaxing, and fulfilling. I can't wait until tomorrow!  
Sorry if this seemed like a shitpost. But I had nowhere else to go with this feeling that I needed to share."
