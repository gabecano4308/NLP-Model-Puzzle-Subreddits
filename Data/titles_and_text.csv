i competed in the american crossword puzzle tournament and wrote this short essay about my experience there i haven t found a place to publish it but i thought my friends in r crossword might enjoy a quick read fingers crossed that this year s tournament can proceed as planned \ a puzzling experience hustling towards the entrance of the stamford marriott on a blustery march evening i m questioning my life choices i ve just driven two hours through the dark connecticut gloom after a full work week to arrive at my destination the american crossword puzzle tournament for the nd year in a row will shortz editor of the industry standard new york times crossword has gathered a bunch of puzzlers like myself to nerd out about word games so here i am pencil in hand ready to meet my crossword destiny what have i gotten myself into i have low expectations i pretty much just don t want to embarrass myself but this is a big tournament and i m weirdly nervous there are entrants this year including rookies people like me who ve never participated i ve been puzzling for years and by nearly any measure i m very good at crosswords but this is a group of seriously smart smarties whose first crossword rodeo this is not the competition is stiff even though very few of us have a chance to win mostly we re here to indulge in a favorite hobby and meet like minded people on a fun weekend vacay but competition is a funny thing it makes people competitive i m a strong puzzler but i ve never had a bar with which to compare my ability maybe i m like really good friday night s festivities aren t part of the competition but more of a welcome reception we do a few puzzles have some wine and cheese real classy like and the thing that surprises me most is the non dorkiness of it all the marriott ballroom is filled with completely normal ish people like myself who just really enjoy crosswords friday evening is fun casual and low pressure nice time saturday however is neither casual nor low pressure and i m not sure if fun is the right word either when you think of doing a crossword you might imagine a serene experience possibly while enjoying a robust cup of coffee maybe in front of a cozy fire on a crisp winter s morn but this is not that this is crosswar you re fixated on a huge clock with massive red numbers ticking away towards the impending doom of an incomplete puzzle clutching your pencil like a truck driver white knuckling through a hail storm we do six puzzles and the whole day is a blur after the first three i m feeling pretty confident i ve only made one total error until i realize i m puzzling way too slow i finish puzzle in about minutes but half of the room has already cleared out having finished before me yikes the fleeting confidence i once felt is flattened by the steamroller known as puzzle it has a weird quirk it s a https www nytimes com crosswords yes you can write more than one letter in a square html puzzle for my fellow crossnerds that i fail to crack in our allotted minutes classic thursday puzzle i finish with times as many errors as the first puzzles combined so errors morale is low fade to black that was surely the last nail in my tournament coffin but now shortz takes the stage and announces that puzzle is the hard one i slog through it and manage to finish albeit with a bunch of errors puzzle feels like a gentle summer breeze after the last two we wrap for the day and i head straight to the bar for some consolation whiskey mentally and emotionally exhausted indulge me for a moment while i describe the physical demands of this tournament yes i m going to whine about the aches and pains of sitting in a chair doing a crossword puzzle first let s talk about pencils like many puzzlers i ve become spoiled by apps and online puzzling pencil and paper take some getting used to manual rigor mortis quickly sets in so after one puzzle you re cruising swiftly down carpal tunnel avenue with your focus in tow then you find your neck semi permanently cocked at an unnatural angle only known to puzzlers plus when you erase something the whole table shakes and everyone knows you re moving backwards shame finishing a puzzle is doubly satisfying because you finally get to stand up sunday we re back at the marriott for the finals one puzzle to decide it all by this time we know where we stand and which competitors have an actual shot to win the thing i am not one of those people before the tournament i d set a goal for myself to finish in the top half of the field but by now it s clear that isn t happening i m ranked and really just want to finish in the top at this point a totally arbitrary goal but whatever something to strive for today s puzzle isn t especially tough but i m all out of brain cells after yesterday s marathon luckily i m in no rush having accepted my fate as an also ran my relaxed approach and well rested pencil wrist lead to my best score of the whole weekend and i catapult myself up the rankings all the way to not spectacular but i m glad to have finished strong ultimately the trophy goes to dan feyer marking his th victory at the american crossword puzzle tournament lessons learned in the end i m really happy i put myself through the gauntlet spending hundreds of dollars and several days of my life to learn that i m not all that good at crosswords it s aspirational and encourages me that puzzling won t get boring anytime soon now that i ve witnessed grid greatness in the flesh i m hooked and it inspires me to elevate my own grid game i ll be back in stamford this

direction letters which i sort of suspected after a few eyerolls was thither so we ll fill that in and across also this makes the fourth letter in a alternate title for mbube also its refrain letters be an o which knocks out my wild guess of kumbaya oh well the first word is e almost certainly the this makes o canine pair letters end in h so we ll fill in teeth at the end word fills in as it nice this in turn makes word be e so also the it follows t and v e so that first word is to and the fourth letter in k participants in an annual puzzle event at m i t is now t contraindicating hackers my faith in c may be restored o canine pair letters t e e t h might be eyeteeth in particular this makes word be e which is encouraging in a the heavy grid and also makes word be e i o s y that first letter at comes right before the h in l huge namibian national park and game reserve letters h and the third letter is the second to last one in k participants in an annual puzzle event at m i t letters h t which is very likely to be an r my point being that word looks like seriously and not deviously or whatever that l makes h stuck firmly in place letters be l which looks like planted word now t a k take that s good word now t to that s also good and f end result final outcome letters be u which looks like upshot also word after when is h so the first letter is a t which reveals u deep and rasping as a growl letters o t as throaty word is p p e r s which is appears more significantly the puzzle starting at is t y e l to v e the l which i think is they are liable to have the last laugh this creates a problem in j seeming to make sense though unproven letters h b and s place attended by aspirants to some degree letters u e looks like university so what s up with that final e luckily both of these are resolved by changing liable to likely giving us university and a more reasonable h e pair in answer j that flurry of letters doesn t open up as much as i had hoped although b make one s way around a chain say hyph letters i s a must be islandhop and p job requirement for most actors letters t o apparently is audition the grid is still not opening up much although word l t after it and is and leading into to take seriously feels like difficult i comedy bash hoot and a half letters u k must be oog yukfest and x oblique line biased letters d a l must be diagonal although i was hoping for a more different than oblique line meaning of biased ok what do we have now starting at we have when t h y r n b o d n g across h e a i v h a t h before appears then later we have after it is difficult to take o u n n a l s seriously b f d e s n t leading into they are likely assuming that b o d n g and o u n are the same word that word would be bounding so we have when they are seen bounding across their native heath and then to take bounding animals seriously but if one doesnt this fully fills in v genre that combines fuji music and highlife with american funk and jazz

that in and across also this make the fourth letter in a alternate title for mbube also it refrain letter be an o which knock out my wild guess of kumbaya oh well the first word is e almost certainly the this make o canine pair letter end in h so we ll fill in teeth at the end word fill in a it nice this in turn make word be e so also the it follows t and v e so that first word is to and the fourth letter in k participant in an annual puzzle event at m i t is now t contraindicating hacker my faith in c may be restored o canine pair letter t e e t h might be eyetooth in particular this make word be e which is encouraging in a the heavy grid and also make word be e i o s y that first letter at come right before the h in l huge namibian national park and game reserve letter h and the third letter is the second to last one in k participant in an annual puzzle event at m i t letter h t which is very likely to be an r my point being that word look like seriously and not deviously or whatever that l make h stuck firmly in place letter be l which look like planted word now t a k take that s good word now t to that s also good and f end result final outcome letter be u which look like upshot also word after when is h so the first letter is a t which reveals u deep and rasping a a growl letter o t a throaty word is p p e r s which is appears more significantly the puzzle starting at is t y e l to v e the l which i think is they are liable to have the last laugh this creates a problem in j seeming to make sense though unproven letter h b and s place attended by aspirant to some degree letter u e look like university so what s up with that final e luckily both of these are resolved by changing liable to likely giving u university and a more reasonable h e pair in answer j that flurry of letter doesn t open up a much a i had hoped although b make one s way around a chain say hyph letter i s a must be islandhop and p job requirement for most actor letter t o apparently is audition the grid is still not opening up much although word l t after it and is and leading into to take seriously feel like difficult i comedy bash hoot and a half letter u k must be oog yukfest and x oblique line biased letter d a l must be diagonal although i wa hoping for a more different than oblique line meaning of biased ok what do we have now starting at we have when t h y r n b o d n g across h e a i v h a t h before appears then later we have after it is difficult to take o u n n a l s seriously b f d e s n t leading into they are likely assuming that b o d n g and o u n are the same word that word would be bounding so we have when they are seen bounding across their native heath and then to take bounding animal seriously but if one doesnt this fully fill in v genre that combine fuji music and highlife with american funk and jazz letter a afrobeat that definition appears to be pulled verbatim from wikipedia fwiw also we can see that d paper flier letter l e a f e t is leaflet j seeming to make sense though unproven letter t h e e t i c is theoretic m partially caught up to wds letter g a i n e n is gainedon and r chum mate pal letter u d i e s is buddy also k participant in an annual puzzle event at m i t letter is now h u n t e r so i guess it is hunter which is somewhat lame i mean i guess it is a puzzle hunt but is it too late to request hacker instead we have four clue left a alternate title for mbube also it refrain letter i m o e h g arrangement involving every character letter a n g r a l huge namibian national park and game reserve letter n a t oops sorry i meant e o s h a and w reaction to cat dander for some letter h i n i i i mean i could guess at three of the four but we ll go to the grid instead after the at the start we have d e s i e to r o p i h l i o n and then after appears starting at we have o be i d e s r e a d leading into it is difficult it s desire to romp with lion and to be widespread so the answer are wimoweh pangram etosha and rhinitis the author is wait just a moment wtf is wimoweh is that supposed to be the lion sleep tonight song oh geez it is well who knew not me apparently an d yway the author is will cuppy and the book is the great bustard which is a bird it turn out just to add to the general confusion after one final mental harrumph we are done

i ve been thinking recently as to what it is that makes a technique advanced on another thread u oldenumber referred to an empty rectangle as advanced and elsewhere has mentioned that unique rectangles should only be used when every other technique has been exhausted oldenumber is an excellent solver better than myself but on this point i massively disagree empty rectangles and unique rectangles are very simple techniques that should be employed early you only need to cross out some numbers to utilise them however it got me thinking what is it that makes a technique advanced to this end id like to throw a proposal forward a technique is more or less advanced based on how many notes it requires to perform the very simplest techniques are basic early game eliminations these require no notes at all then there are a basic simple notes techniques pointing pairs and subsets belong in this category heres where it starts to get complicated what is simple and what is complicated becomes an artifact of the note system we use to those of us that use snyder the single digit turbot fish are advanced techniques requiring a full candidate list but consider an imaginary community of sudoku players who used row snyder that is they noted every instance where a candidate appeared twice on a row for this community an x wing on a row would be dead easy but unique rectangles turbot fish on columns would be advanced in my own game i ve found that ive lost my ability to see subsets like naked triples and pairs on rows and columns as ive become better at snyder u charmingpea made an absolute fool out of me recently when i used w wings and an empty rectangle to crack a puzzle he found a naked triple on row that basically achieved the same thing my argument is closing in on the ridiculous conclusion that a naked pair on a row or column is an advanced technique but a naked pair in a box is simple it is for this reason that im training to add to my game such that i do snyder on rows and columns in a different colour im allergic to notes and there in lies a way out basic techniques no notes simple techniques requires notes but not a full candidates list if a technique requires some but not all candidates its a simple technique naked and hidden subsets for example note that this independent of the notation system you use dont kid yourself that a hidden pair is an advanced technique if its on a row the choice of using box based snyder is arbitrary similarly dont kid yourself that a naked triple is advanced the choice of using snyder where you only mark instances of a candidate is arbitrary whatever scheme you use to classify techniques it should not be dependent on your notation system medium techniques techniques that require extended notes but not a full candidate list i put single digit techniques such as turbot fish here simple chaining like the simple d medusa i do and unique rectangles there is no simple notation strategy that will catch all the turbot fish whether you use simple snyder row snyder or column snyder you re still going to have to cross out a candidate or note that a candidate appears twice on a row my point isnt that you cant spot a turbot fish and mark in the eliminations without snyder you can but you will never find all of them i tentatively put unique rectangles in this category some of them require you to break snyder or cross out candidates in a box a crossed out or red candidate is an extension of simple notes alternatively if you spot these whilst completing the candidate list as i used to number by number you are still spotting them before the candidate list is complete but after you break snyder advanced techniques techniques that require a full candidate list y wings xyz wings w wings bug again its not that you cant spot these without a full candidates list its that you cant spot them all if you did spot one early you just happened to look at just the right cells close enough together that you didnt forget what was in each one way to think about this is that you must know all the candidates in the cells that take part in the technique as opposed to the techniques above where not every candidate need be known extreme techniques techniques that require more than the full candidate list aic and full d medusa even given all the candidates you need to add extra notes like arrows or colours there is a special place in hell for app developers that put puzzles like this in but dont allow coloured candidates im coming now to the point we need to stop calling techniques advanced especially if they are basic turbot fish it sets up a sense of elitism and can put newer players off there is nothing advanced about single digit techniques like an empty rectangle and unique rectangles are easy to spot before the notes list is complete moreover what you think is advanced is often an artefact of your note system for most of us snyder from my point of view at the moment subsets that are not confined to a box are advanced as they dont fit neatly into the notation system that ive taken on months ago before i learnt snyder they were simple techniques thats ridiculous my point of view is garbage subsets are simple techniques regardless of whether or not ive developed a hole in my game or regardless of whether they are in a row column or box your notation system should be a guide not a crutch snyder is great i love that ive learnt it i love how simple and efficient it is i hate that its become an end in and of itself i dont get why one would want to prove that even the hardest puzzles can be cracked with snyder i could also make my life harder by giving up my car and biking to work why bother use the notation system that works best for you when snyder stops working drop it like its hot but id like to start the conversation what does the community think qualifies as an advanced solving trick,0,i ve been thinking recently a to what it is that make a

so i recently started solving sudoku one night cause i couldn t sleep and it s been incredibly fun i downloaded this app called sudoku com on play store and currently it s my go to because i do really like the ui it s clean i was looking around at avg times for different difficulty levels so i can reach those but i found out that different apps difficulty levels are different everywhere like someone s expert could be anothers medium on the app i use i ve begun being able to solve expert level sudoku between mins but upon reading about the difficulties i wondered if the app im using is one of those where the expert is actually just medium i want to be know are there any common apps that the community uses that not only provides the appropriate difficulties but maybe also has some special challenges now and again,0,so i recently started solving sudoku one night cause i couldn t sleep and it s been incredibly fun i downloaded this app called sudoku com on play store and currently it s my go to because i do really like the ui it s clean i wa looking around at avg time for different difficulty level so i can reach those but i found out that different apps difficulty level are different everywhere like someone s expert could be anothers medium on the app i use i ve begun being able to solve expert level sudoku between min but upon reading about the difficulty i wondered if the app im using is one of those where the expert is actually just medium i want to be know are there any common apps that the community us that not only provides the appropriate difficulty but maybe also ha some special challenge now and again
so i ve been thinking about it a bit lately there must be a reason why some puzzles are more fun than others what makes me sit back after the solve and thinking wow that was fun i think much of it has to do with where your are on your learning journey some of the most fun i ve had solving is the first time a technique worked and opened a puzzle other than that i feel like hidden singles often can be more tedium than anything else some puzzles just are one after another of them and that s not fun what usually is interesting is when one technique leads into another it can be so satisfying when one thing leads into another i think that s one thing that makes sudoku dot com so terrible they have a terrible generator that doesn t meet you at your level doesn t prioritize interesting points of the puzzle what s your thoughts,0,so i ve been thinking about it a bit lately there must be a reason why some puzzle are more fun than others what make me sit back after the solve and thinking wow that wa fun i think much of it ha to do with where your are on your learning journey some of the most fun i ve had solving is the first time a technique worked and opened a puzzle other than that i feel like hidden single often can be more tedium than anything else some puzzle just are one after another of them and that s not fun what usually is interesting is when one technique lead into another it can be so satisfying when one thing lead into another i think that s one thing that make sudoku dot com so terrible they have a terrible generator that doesn t meet you at your level doesn t prioritize interesting point of the puzzle what s your thought

introduction whenever i m solving sudoku i like to be able to identify exactly which tricks i m using so whenever i find something that doesn t fit into standard definitions i want to know whether this trick i just found can be explained away by an existing class of techniques or whether i came across something new at some point that led me to developing a sort of theory of everything a technique which comprises all other techniques exception tricks based on uniqueness for reasons that will become clear i ve decided to call it higher order aic hoaic or hoa for short i ll try to explain my definitions as well as i can but if anything is still unclear after reading this which is entirely possible don t hesitate to ask disclaimer although hoa is technically capable of solving any puzzle please note that the search space for hoas of order is already unfathomably large and i have no clue what the minimum order is to solve any puzzle definition strong weak links most people will have heard of the concept of alternate inference chains aic but i suspect that not everybody is exactly clear on what aic means exactly so here s my working definition it begins with the definition of weak and strong links the first important thing to keep in mind is that links exist between candidates not between cells two candidates and are said to be weakly linked if one can show that at most one of them can be true in the solution to the puzzle for example any two candidates of the same cell are weakly linked confirming one leads to immediate elimination of the other similarly any two identical digits in a house are weakly linked i will refer to these types of weak links as primitive weak links two candidates are said to be strongly linked if one can show that at least one of them must be true in the solution to the puzzle any primitive weak link may be a strong link if all other relevant values are eliminated a weak link between two candidates in a cell becomes strong if the cell has only those two candidates remaining similarly a weak link between two identical digits in a house becomes strong if those are the only two possible locations left for that digit in line with the terminology of weak links these examples of strong links will be referred to as primitive strong links if a and b are weakly linked candidates we notate a b if they are strongly linked we notate a b it is tempting to assume that every strong link is also an instance of a weak link it is important to realize that this is in general not true although it holds for primitive links chaining links of alternating strength aic given all strong and weak links in a puzzle we can inductively build up a network of links using the following rule chain extension if a b b c and c d then a d proof we have that at least one of a and b is true and at least one of c and d is true that means that at least of the candidates are true since b and c are weakly linked at most one of them is true therefore at least one of a and d is true having built up this network we can eliminate candidates with the following rule triangle elimination if a b a c and b c then c is false proof suppose instead that c is true then the weak links imply that both a and b are false which contradicts their strong link therefore c must be true i define an aic as any elimination which relies purely on the primitive links and these two rules example https imgur com a vytnphe is an example of an aic the relevant primitive links are written as a chain as follows r c r c r c r c r c r c r c r c by repeatedly applying the chain extension rule we conclude that r c r c the triangle elimination rule using primitive weak links in boxes and and rows and now eliminates the three candidates r c r c and r c strength and weakness of aic notice that the following strategies are all types of aic with some restriction on the type or the number of primitive links used \ pointing pair \ hidden pair \ naked pair \ x wing \ skyscraper \ turbot crane \ string kite \ y wing \ w wing \ x chain \ xy chain \ windmill although aics are very versatile and powerful there are also many techniques which aren t picked up at all since aic relies on strong links it is completely blind to triples and quadruples higher order aic there is a way to remedy the weaknesses of aic which i call the higher order aic hoa although the search space is large and difficult to navigate and it might feel a bit like guessing sometimes hoas are capable of solving any sudoku the idea is that like candidates primitive strong links have a status they may be true or false recall that two candidates are said to be strongly linked if at least one of them must be true let me rephrase that and instead say the strong link between two candidates is true if at least one of the candidates must be true what does this change well the fact that strong links now have a status means that we can now talk about weak and strong links between links let s define some notation \ let a b and c be three candidates if one can show that at least one of these three candidates must be true then we write a b c \ if a c and b c then we also have a b c grouped aic https imgur com a szdqt m is an example of what s known as a grouped aic the relevant links are written as a chain again r c r c r c r c r c r c r c r c r c the interesting bit comes at the end notice that there are places in box where an can go so that ordinary aic would not find this elimination but in this case the last node in this chain is itself a link the chain extension rule is still valid we conclude that r c r c r c since the candidate r c is weakly linked to all three of those candidates it can be eliminated more precisely we have r c r c and r c r c therefore by notation we have r c r c r c since we also have r c r c the triangle elimination rule which also remains valid under this notation shows that r c is false general definition and more examples now comes the real fun if primitive strong links have a status then we might as well define all strong links to have a status we say that a strong link is true if it is the result under the chain extension rule of some chain whose strong links are all true now we can use entire aics as nodes for another chain this generalization of grouped aic is what i would like to refer to as a second order aic now we can define the same notation for quads and statuses of second order chains to obtain third order chains we can continue this process to obtain aics of indefinitely high order what does this mean in practice first if you re comfortable with first order aic type strategies and you can spot them easily it often turns out to be possible to extend a first order aic which doesn t quite work into a second order aic which does i ve found that this is the most common route i personally take to come across these types of eliminations second having an extensive system like this to classify complicated chains helps you convince yourself that your logic is correct but also helps you internalize the logic you used making it easier to spot similar tricks in the future of course this is me talking about my personal experience so take everything with a grain of salt https imgur com a xy za z you can find a short gallery of hoas which i have collected over time note that one of them uses a uniqueness strategy as a node which doesn t fall under my definition however i do think it s a pretty trick so i added it anyway and now there are still unanswered questions is there an efficient way to scan for hoas what is the minimum order necessary to guarantee a solution to any sudoku if this stuff interests you and i m assuming so if you got this far i invite you to think about these questions and please let me know if you come across anything interesting,0,introduction whenever i m solving sudoku i like to be able to identify exactly which trick i m using so whenever i find

hello everyone my name is trevor and i m developing a sudoku app there s plenty of sudoku apps out there already so i m aiming to make this one the very best in service of that goal i m trying to learn about what people like and dislike in the various apps out there i ve gotten into the culture of sudoku and puzzlers in general played around sudoku apps and taken notes on all of them watched a lot of cracking the cryptic a sudoku youtuber read loads of sites about the game and even read some journal articles through all that i found a love for sudoku myself so far i ve built the puzzle generator step by step solver and core ui for the game next i ll focus on the graphics more subtle game design elements my ask of you all i have a lot of questions around game design but i think the simplest way to gather the information i need would be for me to describe some core goals of mine and for you all to pick them apart or support them goals minimal beautiful clean ui sudoku is a game in which a player stares at cells which in sum could contain just under numbers until the player whittles down to a cool numbers in short the game can get very information dense a minimal approach to design will help players more easily read the information they need from the board i ve searched through a ton of sudoku puzzles both paper programmed and i ve yet to find anything as minimal as i would like i ll aim to do two things use minimalist graphic design tricks to avoid unnecessary detail visual noise distracting players somehow encourage players to use the snyder notation system which will minimize the mess of pencilmarks on screen handholding validation hints and highlighting values are all forms of handholding directing the attention of the player to a mistake they made or move they haven t found too much and the player won t feel ownership of the moves they made too little and players will get frustrated there s a delicate balance that i m unsure how to strike to address this hints will still leave some work to the player explained more in the next section incorrect values will be marked incorrect but there won t be a penalty for this learning i probably did hundreds of sudoku puzzles as a kid and i never encountered any talk of techniques or formalized logic i thought guessing was required on fairly simple puzzles because i didn t know any better since i built my own step by step solver for sudoku my app can already provide rich hints when a player requests a hint in my app it doesn t just fill a number in for them it points in the right direction by highlighting a region of the board provides the name of the next useful technique in that region if you ve forgotten that technique or just want a refresher it provides a brief example tutorial tl dr i wanna make the best sudoku app ever i want everyone who enjoys sudoku to think of this app as their preferred way to do puzzles to get my design in line with what sudoku players like i want you all

i ve been developing a strategy based on observations i ve noticed that all solutions to all sudoku puzzles i ve completed have the following characteristic each of the rows for horizontally adjacent regions aka boxes blocks share three sets of unordered pairs or occasionally triads in their rows if the shared sets are pairs then there are three wildcard symbols appearing across the three rows if the shared sets are triads then there are no wildcards example of top three blocks first rows of a recent puzzle the pair appears in the top row left box middle box of the second row and right box of the bottom row the pair appears in the second row left box third row middle box first row right box the pair appears in the third row left box the first row middle box and the second row right box the wildcards for this group of boxes are and this pattern continues for rows and and then again for rows and rows and share unordered pairs and rows and share unordered pairs and the whole solution is at the bottom of this post does this characteristic have a name if there is a proof for it where could i find it my combinatorics and linear algebra skills are not up to snuff to write one myself i would like to read one if it exists although i would most likely struggle greatly to understand it i am aware that there is a strategy called swordfish but that extends across the whole sudoku this strategy applies to just three horizontal blocks aka regions boxes sometimes it isn t so easy to come up with the members of the pairs once i have at least two of the pairs for the horizontally adjacent boxes i can use those as strong hints for candidates of empty cells across the three boxes thank you for your time lmurphy the whole solution for this puzzle \ \,0,i ve been developing a strategy based on observation i ve noticed that all solution to all sudoku puzzle i ve completed have the following characteristic each of the row for horizontally adjacent region aka box block share three set of unordered pair or occasionally triad in their row if the shared set are pair then there are three wildcard symbol appearing across the three row if the shared set are triad then there are no wildcards example of top three block first row of a recent puzzle the pair appears in the top row left box middle box of the second row and right box of the bottom row the pair appears in the second row left box third row middle box first row right box the pair appears in the third row left box the first row middle box and the second row right box the wildcards for this group of box are and this pattern continues for row and and then again for row and row and share unordered pair and row and share unordered pair and the whole solution is at the bottom of this post doe this characteristic have a name if there is a proof for it where could i find it my combinatorics and linear algebra skill are not up to snuff to write one myself i would like to read one if it exists although i would most likely struggle greatly to understand it i am aware that there is a strategy called swordfish but that extends across the whole sudoku this strategy applies to just three horizontal block aka region box sometimes it isn t so easy to come up with the member of the pair once i have at least two of the pair for the horizontally adjacent box i can use those a strong hint for candidate of empty cell across the three box thank you for your time lmurphy the whole solution for this puzzle \ \

hey guys sorry if i m posting this in the wrong place i think it s all good here firstly a bit of backstory a few months ago i logged onto yt and saw a video from ctc appear in my feed i never really got into sudokus when i was younger but decided to click on it because why not turns out it was really really interesting i was hooked i had always thought that sudokus especially the harders ones \ had\ to involve guessing and there was no way around it and that didn t interest me at all yet here were these professional sudoku players using all these cool techniques to solve a sudoku it was amazing i kept watching and after a while learnt there was more than just the standard sudoku who would have guessed long story short i got my friends hooked and we loved it one thing we didn t love though was the lack of certain types of sudokus we really took a liking to the anti knight sudokus that ctc had which was the first video we saw and first sudoku we solved however there didn t really seem to be a great way to actually play anti knight sudokus the ctc website was great for playing sudokus but you couldn t search through the puzzles and find one you liked we also thought about making our own puzzles to challenge each other but couldn t find places that would let you create your own puzzles with custom rules like anti knight or whatever else we came up with eventually i decided to make my own phone app very original i know since we couldn t find anything out there that did everything we wanted it s been going really well i can generate random standard sudokus check for solutions let people make their own sudokus standard and anti knight for now check uniqueness follow logic and a few other cool things but here s where things get a bit tricky and was hoping for the advice of people who have played with sudokus a lot longer than us to see what feels good for them we liked the feel of ctc in that you can have corner or middle pencil marks like this https imgur com o f ipa the only issue is that i want to make killer sudokus now the problem with them though is that based on where the pencil markings can go we don t know how to display the total of the cage without it potentially interfering with the pencil marks so firstly does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to show the total of a cage without it being blocked off or blocking something off secondly how do people feel about having all the numbers highlight when you want to see them all sort of like andoku if anyone s played it i can t decide on how to make that work nicely while having it feel intuitive too but i m not sure if having the numbers highlight are worth doing or not sorry for the long wall of text hopefully everything s formatted nicely so it s not crazy or anything looking forward to hearing from everyone and in the meantime happy solving,0,hey guy sorry if i m posting this in the wrong place i think it s all good here firstly a bit of backstory a few
