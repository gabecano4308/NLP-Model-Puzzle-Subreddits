82,sudoku,Looking for recommendations for Killer Sudoku on iOS (just finished Killer Sudoku! dev by Sarah Pierce),"I’ve been trying a few, like the one from Sudoku.com, Killer Sudoku by Ian Sutton, Killer Sudoku+ by James Gibbs, and they all fall a bit short, such as UI/readability of board, overly intrusive adverts, not being able to sum a range of cages, etc.

83,sudoku,A question about completing harder Sudokus,"Tl;dr Can’t complete high level sudoku without filling in notations for the whole puzzle.

I’ve recently fallen in love with sudokus...I’ve no idea why. But I’ve downloaded Sudoku.com on my phone and found myself completing all of the daily challenges of the past month by month - I’ve already finished the puzzles for the past 4.

Here’s the problem I’m facing however.

With some higher difficulty puzzles I find that it’s almost impossible for me to solve them without filling in notations for every possible number in a block (or the whole puzzle) and then deducing that since that particular number, i.e. a 7, is the only cell in my notations with just that one number, that’s then the only place a 7 could be - and then proceeding on from the rest of the puzzle from there, (which then becomes a cake walk).

However, I feel like this makes the Sudoku no longer a puzzle or logic game, and more of a fill in every possible number notation until only one possible conclusion can be drawn.

Is this due to poor puzzle making or my lack of expertise in sudoku solving strategies? I assume the latter.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I’m having lots of fun!

I can solve the easier puzzles in less than 5 minutes now! When before it took me around 15! So that’s cool."

3,sudoku,What makes a technique advanced??,"I''ve been thinking recently as to what it is that makes a technique ""advanced"". 

On another thread, u/oldenumber777 referred to an empty rectangle as ""advanced"", and elsewhere has mentioned that unique rectangles should only be used when every other technique has been exhausted. Oldenumber is an excellent solver, better than myself, but on this point I massively disagree. Empty rectangles and unique rectangles are very simple techniques that should be employed early; you only need to cross out some numbers to utilise them. 

However, it got me thinking, what is it that makes a technique advanced? To this end, id like to throw a proposal forward. 

A technique is more or less advanced based on how many notes it requires to perform. 

The very simplest techniques are basic early game eliminations, these require no notes at all. 

Then there are a basic simple notes techniques.  Pointing pairs and subsets belong in this category. 

Heres where it starts to get complicated. 

What is simple and what is complicated becomes an artifact of the note system we use. To those of us that use Snyder, the single digit turbot fish are advanced techniques, requiring a full candidate list. But consider an imaginary community of sudoku players who used ""row snyder"", that is, they noted every instance where a candidate appeared twice on a row. For this community an X wing on a row would be dead easy, but unique rectangles, turbot fish on columns, would be advanced. In my own game, i've found that ive lost my ability to see subsets like naked triples and pairs on rows and columns as ive become better at Snyder. U/charmingpea made an absolute fool out of me recently when I used 2 w-wings and an empty rectangle to crack a puzzle- he found a naked triple on row 1 that basically achieved the same thing. My argument is closing in on the ridiculous conclusion that a naked pair on a row or column is an advanced technique, but a naked pair in a box is simple.
It is for this reason that im training to add to my game such that i do snyder on rows and columns in a different colour (im allergic to notes). And there in lies a way out- 

Basic techniques- no notes 

Simple techniques- requires notes but not a full candidates list. If a technique requires some but not all candidates, its a simple technique. Naked and hidden subsets for example. Note that this independent of the notation system you use- dont kid yourself that a hidden pair is an advanced technique if its on a row, the choice of using box based snyder is arbitrary. Similarly dont kid yourself that a naked triple is advanced, the choice of using Snyder where you only mark 2 instances of a candidate is arbitrary. Whatever scheme you use to classify techniques, it should not be dependent on your notation system. 

Medium techniques- techniques that require extended notes but not a full candidate list.  I put single digit techniques such as turbot fish here, simple chaining (like the simple 3d medusa i do), and unique rectangles. There is no simple notation strategy that will catch all the turbot fish. Whether you use simple Snyder, row snyder, or column snyder, you're still going to have to cross out a candidate or note that a candidate appears twice on a row. My point isnt that you cant spot a turbot fish and mark in the eliminations without snyder, you can; but you will never find all of them. I tentatively put unique rectangles in this category; some of them require you to break Snyder or cross out candidates in a box. A crossed out or red candidate is an extension of simple notes. Alternatively, if you spot these whilst completing the candidate list as i used to, number by number, you are STILL  spotting them before the candidate list is complete, but after you break Snyder. 

Advanced techniques- Techniques that require a full candidate list. Y-wings, xyz-wings, w-wings, bug+1. Again, its not that you cant spot these without a full candidates list, its that you cant spot them all. If you did spot one early, you just happened to look at just the right cells close enough together that you didnt forget what was in each. One way to think about this is that you must know all the candidates in the cells that take part in the technique, as opposed to the techniques above, where not every candidate need be known. 

Extreme techniques- techniques that require more than the full candidate list- AIC and full 3d medusa. Even given all the candidates, you need to add extra notes, like arrows or colours. There is a special place in hell for app developers that put puzzles like this in but dont allow coloured candidates. 

Im coming now to the point. 

We need to stop calling techniques ""advanced"". Especially if they are basic turbot fish. It sets up a sense of elitism and can put newer players off. There is nothing advanced about single digit techniques like an empty rectangle, and Unique rectangles are easy to spot before the notes list is complete. 

Moreover what you think is advanced is often an artefact of your note system, for most of us, Snyder. From my point of view, at the moment, subsets that are not confined to a box are ""advanced"" as they dont fit neatly into the notation system that ive taken on. 8 months ago, before I learnt Snyder, they were simple techniques. Thats ridiculous- my point of view is garbage. Subsets are simple techniques regardless of whether or not ive developed a hole in my game, or regardless of whether they are in a row, column or box. 

Your notation system should be a guide, not a crutch. Snyder is great, I love that Ive learnt it, I love how simple and efficient it is. I hate that its become an end in and of itself. I dont get why one would want to prove that even the hardest puzzles can be cracked with Snyder. I could also make my life harder by giving up my car and biking to work- why bother? Use the notation system that works best for you. When Snyder stops working, drop it like its hot. 

But id like to start the conversation, what does the community think qualifies as an advanced solving trick?"

16,sudoku,"What makes a puzzle fun, what makes it tedious and annoying.","So I've been thinking about it a bit lately, there must be a reason why some puzzles are more fun than others.

Other than that I feel like hidden singles often can be more tedium than anything else,  some puzzles just are one after another of them, and that's not fun. What usually is interesting is when one technique leads into another, it can be so satisfying when one thing leads into another.

I'd prefer iOS but have access to an android phone to check out any recommendations.

* Highlighting cells based on multiple digits.  Press 1 and then 2 and only cells which contain both 1 and 2 are highlighted.  I used an app years (and maybe even a decade) ago which had this feature but I can't remember the name.  Might even have been a thin client.

* When asking for a hint, Sudoku+ gives you one particular technique and AFAIK, most apps do the same.  It'd be cool to have a list of all techniques which could be brought to bear at this particular point in the puzzle to progress.

* A training mode where a partially-solved puzzle is presented where a particular technique (or one from a list) could be used to progress.  For example, a user could select XY and XYZ as techniques and the app would present a puzzle at the point where one of these techniques could be used to progress.

Anyone know of any apps which include these features?  Doesn't have to be all in the same app, I'm OK with using different apps depending on where I want to improve."

55,sudoku,Higher Order Alternate Inference Chains (warning: long technical post),"**Introduction**

Whenever I'm solving Sudoku, I like to be able to identify exactly which tricks I'm using. So whenever I find something that doesn't fit into standard definitions, I want to know whether this trick I just found can be explained away by an existing class of techniques, or whether I came across something new. At some point that led me to developing a sort of theory of everything, a technique which comprises all other techniques (exception: tricks based on uniqueness). For reasons that will become clear, I've decided to call it Higher Order AIC (HOAIC or HOA for short). I'll try to explain my definitions as well as I can, but if anything is still unclear after reading this -- which is entirely possible -- don't hesitate to ask.

Disclaimer: although HOA is technically capable of solving any puzzle, please note that the search space for HOAs of order 3 is already unfathomably large, and I have no clue what the minimum order is to solve any puzzle. 

**Definition Strong/Weak Links**

Most people will have heard of the concept of Alternate Inference Chains (AIC), but I suspect that not everybody is exactly clear on what AIC means exactly. So here's my working definition.

It begins with the definition of weak and strong links. The first important thing to keep in mind is that links exist between candidates, not between cells. Two candidates and are said to be weakly linked if one can show that at most one of them can be true in the solution to the puzzle. For example, any two candidates of the same cell are weakly linked (confirming one leads to immediate elimination of the other). Similarly, any two identical digits in a house are weakly linked. I will refer to these types of weak links as primitive weak links.

Two candidates are said to be strongly linked if one can show that at least one of them must be true in the solution to the puzzle. Any primitive weak link may be a strong link if all other relevant values are eliminated: a weak link between two candidates in a cell becomes strong if the cell has only those two candidates remaining. Similarly, a weak link between two identical digits in a house becomes strong if those are the only two possible locations left for that digit. In line with the terminology of weak links, these examples of strong links will be referred to as primitive strong links.

If A and B are weakly linked candidates, we notate A---B. If they are strongly linked, we notate A===B. It is tempting to assume that every strong link is also an instance of a weak link. It is important to realize that this is in general not true, although it holds for primitive links.

**Chaining Links of Alternating Strength (AIC)**

Given all strong and weak links in a puzzle, we can inductively build up a network of links using the following rule (chain extension):

If A===B, B---C and C===D, then A===D.

Proof: we have that at least one of A and B is true, and at least one of C and D is true. That means that at least 2 of the 4 candidates are true. Since B and C are weakly linked, at most one of them is true, therefore at least one of A and D is true.

Having built up this network, we can eliminate candidates with the following rule (triangle elimination)

If A===B, A---C and B---C, then C is false.

Proof: suppose instead that C is true. Then the weak links imply that both A and B are false, which contradicts their strong link. Therefore C must be true.

I define an AIC as any elimination which relies purely on the primitive links and these two rules.

**Example**

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/vYtnPHE) is an example of an AIC. The relevant primitive links are written as a chain, as follows:

(r1c6, 9)===(r9c6, 9)---(r9c2, 9)===(r9c2, 7)---(r9c3, 7)===(r2c3, 7)---(r2c8, 7)===(r2c8, 9). 

By repeatedly applying the chain extension rule, we conclude that (r1c6, 9)===(r2c8, 9). The triangle elimination rule (using primitive weak links in boxes 2 and 3 and rows 1 and 2) now eliminates the three candidates (r1c7, 9), (r1c8, 9) and (r2c4, 9).

**Strength and Weakness of AIC**

Notice that the following strategies are all types of AIC with some restriction on the type or the number of primitive links used:

\- Pointing Pair

\- Hidden Pair

\- Naked Pair

\- X-Wing

\- Skyscraper

\- Turbot Crane

\- 2-String Kite

\- Y-Wing

\- W-Wing

\- X-Chain

\- XY-Chain

\- Windmill

Although AICs are very versatile and powerful, there are also many techniques which aren't picked up at all: since AIC relies on strong links, it is completely blind to triples and quadruples. 

**Higher Order AIC**

There is a way to remedy the weaknesses of AIC, which I call the Higher Order AIC (HOA). Although the search space is large and difficult to navigate (and it might feel a bit like guessing sometimes), HOAs are capable of solving any Sudoku.

The idea is that, like candidates, primitive strong links have a status: they may be true or false. Recall that two candidates are said to be strongly linked if at least one of them must be true. Let me rephrase that and instead say: the strong link between two candidates is true if at least one of the candidates must be true.

What does this change? Well, the fact that strong links now have a status means that we can now talk about weak and strong links between links. Let's define some notation.

\- Let A, B and C be three candidates. If one can show that at least one of these three candidates must be true, then we write A===(B===C). (1)

\- If A---C and B---C, then we also have (A===B)---C. (2)

**Grouped AIC**

[This](https://imgur.com/a/sZdqT4m) is an example of what's known as a Grouped AIC. The relevant links are written as a chain again:

(r7c4, 8)===(r7c4, 9)---(r7c2, 9)===(r9c2, 9)---(r9c2, 4)===(r6c2, 4)---(r6c2, 8)===((r4c1, 8)===(r4c2, 8)). 

The interesting bit comes at the end. Notice that there are 3 places in box 4 where an 8 can go, so that ordinary AIC would not find this elimination. But in this case, the last node in this chain is itself a link. The chain extension rule is still valid: we conclude that (r7c4, 8)===((r4c1, 8)===(r4c2, 8)). Since the candidate (r4c4, 8) is weakly linked to all three of those candidates, it can be eliminated. More precisely, we have:

(r4c1, 8)---(r4c4, 8) and (r4c2, 8)---(r4c4, 8). 

Therefore by notation (2), we have ((r4c1, 8)===(r4c2, 8))---(r4c4, 8). Since we also have (r7c4, 8)---(r4c4, 8), the triangle elimination rule (which also remains valid under this notation) shows that (r4c4, 8) is false.

**General Definition and More Examples**

Now comes the real fun. If primitive strong links have a status, then we might as well define all strong links to have a status! We say that a strong link is true if it is the result under the chain extension rule of some chain whose strong links are all true. Now we can use entire AICs as nodes for another chain! This generalization of Grouped AIC is what I would like to refer to as a second-order AIC. Now we can define the same notation for quads and statuses of second order chains to obtain third order chains. We can continue this process to obtain AICs of indefinitely high order.

What does this mean in practice? First, if you're comfortable with first-order AIC-type strategies and you can spot them easily, it often turns out to be possible to extend a first-order AIC which doesn't quite work into a second-order AIC which does. I've found that this is the most common route I personally take to come across these types of eliminations. Second, having an extensive system like this to classify complicated chains helps you convince yourself that your logic is correct, but also helps you internalize the logic you used, making it easier to spot similar tricks in the future. Of course, this is me talking about my personal experience, so take everything with a grain of salt.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Xy9zA6Z) you can find a short gallery of HOAs which I have collected over time. Note that one of them uses a Uniqueness strategy as a node, which doesn't fall under my definition. However, I do think it's a pretty trick, so I added it anyway.

**And now?**

There are still unanswered questions. Is there an efficient way to scan for HOAs? What is the minimum order necessary to guarantee a solution to any sudoku? If this stuff interests you (and I'm assuming so if you got this far), I invite you to think about these questions and please let me know if you come across anything interesting!"

I'm a long-time reader of this subreddit but only now created an account. I often see people recommending their favorite apps here and I thought there might be some users interested in mine.

For years I've used the Sudoku app from *MindTheFrog*, because it was the simplest with no distracting ads or features no one needs like highscores, etc. But now I made my own app, **SudoKoi**, which works just how I like it.

The app is pretty simple, but well-designed. There are no ads and no fancy stuff like high scores. It supports **regular Sudoku** and also **Killer Sudoku** which I really enjoy. If you have an **Apple Pencil** you can also write directly on the grid and the drawing gets turned into numbers. And there's lots of hidden features like intelligent undo, double tap on a number to lock it such that tapping on a cell enters the number immediately, and the list goes on. If you like **widgets** in iOS 14 you can also add Sudokus directly to your Home screen and it will change every couple hours.

Oh and the app is free with a handful of puzzles for each rating. The full version with thousands of puzzles requires you to pay, but that's mainly because I spent over 1.000 $ on licensing puzzles from well-known authors like Andrew Stuart to have really **high-quality puzzles** in the app.

According to the rules, to check the validity of a sudoku grid, one must :

1) Check rows

2) Check columns

3) If rows and columns are valid, then check 3x3 squares

I don't see how 3) is possible. As far as I can see, if the grid is filled and a 3x3 square is invalid, then necessarily some row or column will also be invalid. Is my assumption wrong? Could anyone provide a counter-example if it is?

14,sudoku,Yet another Sudoku app (developer),"## Hello everyone!

My name is Trevor and I'm developing a Sudoku app. There's plenty of Sudoku apps out there already, so I'm aiming to make this one the **very best**. In service of that goal, I'm trying to learn about what people like and dislike in the various apps out there. I've gotten into the culture of Sudoku (and puzzlers in general), played around 40 Sudoku apps and taken notes on all of them, watched a lot of Cracking the Cryptic (a Sudoku Youtuber), read loads of sites about the game, and even read some journal articles. Through all that, I found a love for Sudoku myself.

So far I've built the puzzle generator, step-by-step solver, and core UI for the game. Next, I'll focus on the graphics &amp; more subtle game design elements.

### My Ask of You All
I have a lot of questions around game design, but I think the simplest way to gather the information I need would be for me to describe some core goals of mine, and for you all to pick them apart (or support them). ;)

## Goals
### Minimal, Beautiful, Clean UI
Sudoku is a game in which a player stares at 81 cells which, in sum, could contain just under 81*9 = 721 numbers, until the player whittles down to a cool 81 numbers. In short, the game can get very information dense. A minimal approach to design will help players more easily ""read"" the information they need from the board. I've searched through a ton of Sudoku puzzles, both paper &amp; programmed, and I've yet to find anything as minimal as I would like. I'll aim to do two things...

 1. Use minimalist graphic design tricks to avoid unnecessary detail &amp; visual noise distracting players.
 2. (Somehow) encourage players to use the Snyder notation system, which will minimize the mess of pencilmarks on screen.

### Handholding
Validation, hints, and highlighting values are all forms of handholding -- directing the attention of the player to a mistake they made or move they haven't found. Too much and the player won't feel ownership of the moves they made, too little and players will get frustrated. There's a delicate balance that I'm unsure how to strike. To address this...
 
 1. Hints will still leave some work to the player (explained more in the next section).
 2. Incorrect values will be marked incorrect, but there won't be a penalty for this.

### Learning
I probably did hundreds of Sudoku puzzles as a kid, and I never encountered any talk of techniques or formalized logic. I thought guessing was required on fairly simple puzzles because I didn't know any better. Since I built my own step-by-step solver for Sudoku, my app can already provide rich hints. When a player requests a hint in my app it doesn't just fill a number in for them. It...
1. Points in the right direction by highlighting a region of the board.
2. Provides the name of the next useful technique in that region.
3. If you've forgotten that technique or just want a refresher, it provides a brief example/tutorial.

## TL;DR
I wanna make the best Sudoku app ever. I want everyone who enjoys Sudoku to think of this app as their preferred way to do puzzles. To get my design in line with what Sudoku players like I want you all tear apart, support, or roast my ideas OR make suggestions and point me toward things that could guide me.

Regardless, I really appreciate anyone reading this. Sorry, for my compulsive, commas. And thank you for your time! :)"

Trying to understand what this hint is telling me. I get that if r5c7 was 3 that would force r5c1 to be 2. I also get that when r5c1 is force to 2 that pushes the 3 in box 4 to r6c2. I am struggling with the idea that it also pushes the 3 in box 5 to r6r5 thus creating a conflict and proving that r5c7 could not be 3. Can someone help me understand the logic here?"

I really enjoyed this because it wasn't so overwhelming to see tons of small numbers. It's also very easy to pick out when a number is eliminated, because a single number in a box means that's the only candidate it can be.

Now that I'm getting to more challenging puzzles and trying to learn more complicated techniques, I'm seeing guides say I need to mark all candidates in a square.

Do most people do puzzles by doing the all candidates in every open square technique? Going from my two number system to a bunch of numbers is feeling like I'm looking for a needle in a haystack.

33,sudoku,Need help understanding why this xy chain failed,"I have been using Enjoy Sudoku to learn some sudoku strategies. I attempted to do an xy chain and used the xy chain to eliminate the 6 from r4c4 (chain went from r4c5, r3c5, r3c6, r1c6, r1c3). Then I used ""check entries"" and it told me ""some of my pencil marks are incorrect"" meaning that r4c4 actually was supposed to be a 6.

What did I do wrong with my xy chain that I ended up being incorrect in eliminating the 6?

But the same is true for r4c2, as well. So I also deleted the 5 from r4c2, did ""check entries"" and it told me there was a problem with the pencil marks (because clearly that box is supposed to be the 5.

What's the difference between r5c2 and r4c3 that would point me to r5c2 being the correct choice in the ""hidden unique rectangle""?

My husband says its a pattern, but he can't explain why it's an eight...""","[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sudoku/comments/ixe2ed/help_why_is_c9_r7_eight_with_the_info_ive_marked/?ref_source=pm&amp;ref=share).

Hi, OP's husband here. The reason I knew C9 R7 was the eight is pretty straight-forward to me but OP didn't like my explanation (and most here probably won't either).

It's based more on pattern recognition and manipulation, matching, and excluding than the mathematics of the game. I can re-create this in most situations, without having to rely on other methods, or I wouldn't even retort. I'm not guessing.


So I play by scanning notation. It's how I learned and I personally find the solver method visually messy. In scanning notation you place possible pairs or triplets of a number based on exclusion, right? After a while, you see patterns of cell number pairs and they happen either in rows, columns, or diagonally within the box. 

This notation loves straight line pairs, not diagonals. That's my #1 clue of a number that is out of place.  It also loves for things to visually match so exclusion is easier. When the board allows, I manipulate my pairs to match in placement.


Back to this board: noting only the eights, it was clear to me that the notation of a possible eight in C9 R1 was out of place; it was diagonal to its match in C7 R3. There was no way that any possible placement of the eight could happen in R2 of that box. The only other option was to move that eight in C9 R1 to C8 R1. *It matches the layout of the eights in the box to its left perfectly in placement and in a straight line without excluding other possibilities AND gives you the options for eights in the first upper left box.* Move that noted eight and the placement of the other eight becomes C9 R7 from exclusion.

It griped me that OP, and others, said I was guessing. If I can repeat this particular method correctly over and over it's not guessing, just another method. Is this the only method of solving I use? No, just one of many tools I find helpful."

55,sudoku,[RANT] The Daily Killer Sudoku interface drives me crazy,"I play the [Daily Killer Sudoku](Dailykillersudoku.com) puzzles a lot (daily, even).

As usual, I enter my candidates. Then it comes time to fill the cells with the correct number. But unlike EVERY OTHER SUDOKU APP INTERFACE EVER, entering a correct number doesn’t fill the cell, it just removes it as a candidate - and there’s no way to switch between entry modes.

So if I have 79 as candidates, and I know the cell is a 9, intuitively I’ll hit 9 to fill the cell - but no, it doesn’t fill the cell with a 9, it fills it with a 7.

Despite using the site daily (usually several puzzles a day), I STILL make this mistake EVERY FUCKING TIME and I sometimes don’t notice right away that it’s filling the wrong numbers.

It’s so unintuitive to me. I just wish there was some way to switch entry modes between number/candidate (like every other interface).

Hi guys, I just solved this sudoku using an unusual technique - I thought i would share it. 

I'm not sure what the technique is called, but every number in the red area must also appear in the blue boxes. The 1/3 pair in R2 means that the total number of 3's possible in the blue zones is two. This forces a 3 in R4C7 because if we place a 3 in R4C3, it forces another 3 in R7C7  (and vice versa) - which would make the red zone have three 3's.

This is probably not as easy to spot as the swordfish on 5's but it was still exciting to spot."

88,sudoku,Repetition/patterns in miracle sudokus,"Edit: i thought miracle sudoku was the name of sudokus with the non consecutive numbers constraint, which is what this post is about

-------

I can't help but notice that whenever i do a non consecutive number sudoku there is some obvious form of repetitions when looking at any group of three numbers from the same 3x3 cell

Take this sudoku for example 

https://preview.redd.it/furjb1gnlym51.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee547be0b6a02aea3ca2070dc0d50eb9cb2690a

the 4, 7 and 1 will always share a column in any 3x3 cell. When looking from the top cell down to the bottom cell it will always be in the order ""471"" repeating. Meaning that if the top of the column is a 1 it will be followed by a 4 under it and a 7 under the 4.   


You can notice the same effect with other groups of 3 digits that share a cell. I've been able to solve several non consecutive number sudokus now by effectively guessing based on this pattern.  


I was wondering if these patterns are something of a mathematical rule in these type of sudokus making my guesses effectively just a real way to deduce where a number goes, or if it's just something that's common in miracle sudokus but not common enough to rely on.  


i've searched google images for solved non consecutive number sudokus and the ones I've found all have these patterns"

15,sudoku,iOS App by Zach Gage,"I’ve been using this app quite a bit the last week and wanted to share it on here. 

[Good Sudoku](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/good-sudoku-by-zach-gage/id1489118195) by Zach Gage. The dev was highlighted in the App Store some time back for Really Bad Chess, as well as his unique minimalist and pleasing UI in his other puzzle apps. 

Good Sudoku has his usual stylisation, so the UI isn’t my favourite on an app, but it does have enough customisation to make it functional and I have gotten used to most of its quirks. Aesthetically it is beautiful.

It has Daily Puzzles (that appear to be based on local Timezone) with an online leaderboard. Each day of the week is a different difficulty. The online leaderboard is cool, but it isn’t implemented fantastically so I ignore it.

The Daily Puzzles come in 3 flavours, Good (standard customisation you’d expect on an app), Classic (pen and paper experience), and Arcade (3 mistakes and you fail). Classic does not appear outside of the Daily Puzzles, but as far as I can tell it is just Good with all of the customisation options turned off, and you can do that manually and the app saves the settings. 

You can play sudoku in [5 different difficulties](https://imgur.com/a/vNYEOgK/). The highest difficulty only has 7,000 puzzles to play. You can also play each of those difficulties in Arcade and Eternal mode. I play in Eternal mode. This is endless arcade but you only heal 1/4 heart each sudoku. Note that this mean I don’t enter any incorrect answers, but if you don’t play Arcade or Eternal you have the option to make mistakes. 

The app will alert you when you are in an unwinnable situation where you have not only made a mistake, but proceeded to make an invalid sudoku, and give you the option of reverting back to your last correct state. You can do this action manually at any time also.

You can also create sudoku manually to solve in the app. You can’t do a photo import, but you can share and import from other users. 

The app uses a logic based solver and hint system based on the strategies listed in the difficulties. Every puzzle is solvable using only those strategies. The hint system will highlight any relevant cells and pencil marks for any particular strategy and explain to you how to come to that solution.

You can also go into a learn mode and target any technique individually. I have looked at every technique in the app and *most* of them make sense to me. Some of them did need outside resources for me to understand, but I am very new to sudoku.

When creating sudoku I have encountered puzzles in other apps (CTC Classic Sudoku, Sudoku ME, and on the help thread here) that this app claims are unsolvable. Even if you do partially solve them past the problem technique, the app will not acknowledge it until you completely solve it. I have only had this happen rarely. Each time HoDoKu was able to solve it. One was a w-wing and I can’t remember the others.

It would be super cool if we could share our times for sudoku in this thread. You could also create a particular puzzle that you know of that we could all attempt."

Rules:

1. Normal sudoku rules apply (Obviously)
2. Cells colored red are ""hot"" cells; all orthogonally adjacent cells have a lower value than the hot cell.
3. Cells colored blue are ""cold"" cells; all orthogonally adjacent cells have a higher value than the cold cell.
4. &lt;VERY IMPORTANT&gt; **All cells that can be colored, has been colored**. Uncolored cells are higher   than some of it's neighboring cells and lower than the others at the same time.

For puzzle 1 and 4: Anti-knight rules apply; Cells a chess knight's move away cannot contain the same number.

Here goes.

7,sudoku,Where is the problem with this squirmbag (or sudoku)?,"So I'm currently solving the sudoku from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XWZfwWGUs).

There is some extra rules regarding the arrows but for the purpose of my question they don't really matter (check the video if you care to know).

As far as I can see the yellow cells form a squirmbag (5-base fish) for the numbers 8 and 9, with r12469 being the base sets and c34567 being the cover sets. This would allow me to remove both 8 and 9 from the red cells.

But then there is only one cell left for both 8 and 9 in the center bottom box. So there's a contradition.

I'm about 99% sure that all other cells in the base sets cannot contain 8 or 9 because they all have arrows and the rules regarding them make both 8 and 9 impossible for those cells. So assuming I'm correct with this, is there anything else that I could be doing wrong here?

Thanks!

I'm I doing this right? I always select random empty space, input possible numbers and then move onto the next empty space and do the same. Then I repeat it over and over until I have only one possibility. I feel like I should look for something more specific and not just blindly input possible numbers and hope for the best.

Twice in row I ended up with all spaces filled with multiple possible numbers and I had no idea what to chose. When this happens I find ""pairs"" that have similiar/same possible 2 numbers and then guess one of them. This leaves only one possibility for the next one. Then it usually allows me to input correct number elsewhere and so on until the puzzle is finished.

Here are examples: https://imgur.com/a/X236qg7

(ignore the selected squares)

I'm pretty sure I shouldn't be guessing but everything I found that could help me was too complicated and I barely undestood a word.

What I'm asking here is if you could tell me what to do in those cases (perhaps how to avoid them), preferably in words that even a complete idiot (me) could understand.

Thanks in advance.

Its simple and straight forward and even has a hint function to help you identify and learn the next steps to try and solve the puzzle. However, one important one that I've been trying to look out for is the Unique Rectangle rule, as its helped me solve quite a few. However, I don't know if its the app in particular at generating the puzzles, but I find a few discrepancies when it comes down to this rule as shown below on my most recent solve:

Its just that there's been multiple times where I've used the in-app hint and it will tell me about the Unique Rectangle and liberally use it; but in this image I swore that these are a unique rectangle situation. If not please explain to me why swapping either of those two combination wouldn't resolve to be a unique solution.

Sorry for my newbie question; just a weird discrepancy that I'd like an answer to try and understand the logic."

39,sudoku,Need some aesthetic advice for my sudoku app,"Hey guys

So, I've been in the process of making a sudoku app for a while after not finding any out there that do what I want. It's almost done (which is insane!!!), and I'm up to one of my final steps: making everything look good!

I've got to a point where I'm tossing up between two different designs ([click here to see it](https://imgur.com/a/pshjVHb)) for the input section of the app. This will be sitting below the grid, and I wanted to get some more input as to what people prefer when it comes to the looks of the inputs. 

Basically, the only difference is that with the view on the right, the input buttons (1-9) are all touching, while the buttons on the outside (pencil marking choices, undo/redo, save, check etc) have a bit of a gap between them all. The view on the left has a uniform spacing between all buttons.

As it stands, it's split exactly 50/50 with everyone I've asked, so I thought I'd give everyone here a say and see what you all prefer!

If you have any questions about my app, or any suggestions you'd like to talk about, feel free to! I'm making this app because nothing meets the needs of what I want in a sudoku app, so if there's something you're passionate about in an app, let me know!

I have it posted at [logic masters germany](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000441), but will also include all the rules here.

&amp;#x200B;

 In this puzzle you are a wizard advising for the King on the state of a battle taking place in a mountain range.  
You observe the battlefield using magic and didn't see much because the spell was a bit twisted, so you cast your magic again to see the whole area. see that there isn't any fighting going on because the knights are all over the place and can't see each other!  


Rules:  
1. Normal sudoku rules apply  
2. The center box (box 5) is a magic square.  
3. One of the other boxes is a magic square that has been shifted either vertically or horizontally. The row or column that was shifted re-appears on the other side, but inside the same box. Example if a box had a row XYZ and was shifted right then it would be ZXY instead.  
4. Anti-Knight restrictions apply. (A number cannot see itself a chess-knights move away  
5. Along the thermometers numbers must increase from bulb to the other end.

If you see an unique rectangle then you can just choose one of the 2 options and continue solving it (assuming you haven't done some error)

[https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Unique\_Rectangles](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Unique_Rectangles)

Also even if a sudoku has just one solution you might still not be able to solve it using logic 

[https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Weekly\_Sudoku.asp](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Weekly_Sudoku.asp)

What having more than one solution does is to change the nature of the challenge. 

1. using strategies that assume there is only one solution can end badly, it's harder if you cannot use these uniqueness strategies. 
2. you will have to spot if a sudoku has too few clues for an unique solution. 
3. a guess is more likely to be a solution since some cells will have more than one possible solution. 

So it comes down to a personal preferences, what you enjoy solving"

Doppelblock + Consecutive-on-Line Sudoku (5★): Each row, column, and 3x3 box contains 1-7 and two circles. Outside clues are the sum of the numbers between the two circles in that row or column. Along each line, any two adjacent numbers are consecutive (ex. 454, 12343). Circles on a line are considered blank spaces, and the two numbers on either side of the circle must be consecutive (ex. 3-circle-45, 3-2-1-circle).

There is nothing really spectacular about the pattern except all the cells are bunched together.  It becomes more apparent how cool this one is once you see it with a highlighted the kill zone and target candidate to kill:

""Rules of Classic Sudoku apply. Additionally, If the absolute difference between two digits in neighbouring cells equals 1, then they're separated by a white dot. If the digit in a cell is half of the digit in a neighbouring cell, then they're separated by a black dot. The dot staying between '1' and '2' can have any of these dots.""

I've been doing sudokus basically since the whole lockdown started here and I love it. One issue I've been having however, is finding a place online to solve sudokus. Due to some health issues I'm stuck in bed a lot and my phone is too heavy (so I use my laptop) to hold on to for a longer time, so I'm looking for a better site.  


I'm using Sudoku Exchange right now and I love it, but I really miss the hints. What I'm looking for is a site that provides you with hints when stuck (still trying to learn!) but also removes notes when filling in numbers (and ideally stating something is wrong, but I can definitely live without that).

7,sudoku,Shared pair sets across boxes - potential strategy,"I've been developing a strategy based on observations. I've noticed that all solutions to all Sudoku puzzles I've completed have the following characteristic:

Each of the 3 rows for horizontally adjacent regions (aka boxes, blocks) share three sets of unordered pairs (or occasionally triads) in their rows. If the shared sets are pairs, then there are three 'wildcard' symbols appearing across the three rows. If the shared sets are triads, then there are no 'wildcards.'

Example of top three blocks (first 3 rows) of a recent puzzle:

4  **9  6**  |  1  5  7  |  *8*  3  *2*

*2*  1  *8*  |  3  **9  6**  |  7  4  5

7  5  3  |  *2  8*  4  |  1  **9  6**

The pair **9,6** appears in the top row left box, middle box of the second row, and right box of the bottom row. The pair *2,8* appears in the second row, left box, third row middle box, first row right box. The pair 5,7 appears in the third row left box, the first row middle box, and the second row right box. The wildcards for this group of boxes are 4, 3, and 1.

This pattern continues for rows 4, 5, and 6, and then again for rows 7, 8, and 9. Rows 4, 5, and 6 share unordered pairs (9,2) (1,5) and (3,7). Rows 7, 8, and 9 share unordered pairs (4,9) (2,7) and (1,3). The whole solution is at the bottom of this post.

**Does this characteristic have a name?** If there is a **proof for it**, where could I find it? My combinatorics and linear algebra skills are not up to snuff to write one myself. I would like to read one, if it exists, although I would most likely struggle greatly to understand it. I am aware that there is a strategy called 'swordfish' but that extends across the whole Sudoku. This strategy applies to just three horizontal blocks (aka regions, boxes).

Sometimes it isn't so easy to come up with the members of the pairs. Once I have at least two of the pairs for the horizontally adjacent boxes, I can use those as strong hints for candidates of empty cells across the three boxes.

Thank you for your time,

Lmurphy

Sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place - I think it's all good here. Firstly, a bit of backstory: a few months ago I logged onto YT and saw a video from CTC appear in my feed. I never really got into Sudokus when I was younger, but decided to click on it, because why not? Turns out, it was really, REALLY interesting! I was hooked! 

I had always thought that Sudokus - especially the harders ones - \*had\* to involve guessing, and there was no way around it, and that didn't interest me at all, yet here were these professional Sudoku players using all these cool techniques to solve a Sudoku! It was amazing! I kept watching, and after a while learnt there was more than just the standard Sudoku! Who would have guessed?!? Long story short, I got my friends hooked and we loved it.

One thing we didn't love though was the lack of certain types of Sudokus. We really took a liking to the anti-knight sudokus that CTC had (which was the first video we saw and first sudoku we solved). However, there didn't really seem to be a great way to actually play anti-knight sudokus. The CTC website was great for playing sudokus, but you couldn't search through the puzzles and find one you liked. We also thought about making our own puzzles to challenge each other, but couldn't find places that would let you create your own puzzles with custom rules (like anti-knight or whatever else we came up with). 

Eventually, I decided to make my own phone app (very original, I know!) since we couldn't find anything out there that did everything we wanted. It's been going really well - I can generate random standard sudokus, check for solutions, let people make their own sudokus (standard and anti-knight for now), check uniqueness, follow logic and a few other cool things!

But, here's where things get a bit tricky, and was hoping for the advice of people who have played with sudokus a lot longer than us to see what feels good for them. We liked the feel of CTC in that you can have corner or middle pencil marks like this:

[Pencil Markings](https://imgur.com/O6F1Ipa)

The only issue is that I want to make killer sudokus now - the problem with them though is that based on where the pencil markings can go, we don't know how to display the total of the cage without it potentially interfering with the pencil marks. So, firstly, does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to show the total of a cage without it being blocked off or blocking something off?

Secondly, how do people feel about having all the numbers highlight when you want to see them all (sort of like Andoku if anyone's played it?) I can't decide on how to make that work nicely while having it feel intuitive too, but I'm not sure if having the numbers highlight are worth doing or not?

Sorry for the long wall of text - hopefully everything's formatted nicely so it's not crazy or anything. 

Looking forward to hearing from everyone, and in the meantime, happy solving!"

My theory here is that r2c1/r3c1 form a sort of X-Wing with r2c5/r3c6 and eliminate r2c7/r3c8, making r1c8 1 '1'.

Questions:

1. Is that always true?
2. What is this called? It doesn't feel like an X-Wing because the c5/c6 1's aren't in a column together, but it seems to behave the same way, unless I'm missing something."

I have just started solving hard sudokus in the newspaper without reading articles about the different techniques one can apply. Would you reccomend reading about x-wings, xy-crosses and other techniques or would the knowledge of them ruin the experience of solving the sudokus?

More specific: If one knows all the techniques of sudoku, is the game still fun and challenging? Does reading more about the subject turn sudoku into a trivial game of pattern recognition?

0,sudoku,"Hey guys, looking for new Sudoku in print?","Hello all,

I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Pure Mathematics an my uni, and started getting really into the mathematics of Sudoku, after having played for a little over 10 years now.  In my free time over the past 6 months, I developed and refined an algorithm for writing, grading, and rendering Sudoku puzzles from scratch.

Anyway, I decided to use the algorithm to write a Sudoku book series called 'Not So Simple Sudoku'! There are some unique things I added to the first few books: each starting puzzle contains no '9's (and yes, they are all solvable ;-) ), making them a little more interesting; the puzzles are not symmetric, nor visually balanced in the classic way (again, to make them a little more interesting); for medium puzzles, it is 'possible' for a beginner to solve them, but more advanced strategies make them much easier (I remember as a beginner, it was frustrating to start a puzzle a little out of my range, then realize half-way through I had no idea how to finish it).

 The first three books are now published (in print) and can be found on amazon at the following links:

&amp;#x200B;

[Not So Simple Sudoku, Red Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Simple-Sudoku-Red-challenging/dp/B08CFPXL95/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Not+So+Simple+Sudoku&amp;qid=1594333294&amp;sr=8-3)

[Not So Simple Sudoku, Yellow Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Not-So-Simple-Sudoku-Yellow/dp/B08CFVQBF5/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Not+So+Simple+Sudoku&amp;qid=1594333343&amp;sr=8-3)

[Not So Simple Sudoku, Orange Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Simple-Sudoku-Orange-challenging/dp/B08C95PFNX/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Not+So+Simple+Sudoku&amp;qid=1594333384&amp;sr=8-5)

&amp;#x200B;

I will post about new editions over the next few months (currently working on set of puzzles with exactly two solutions each, and another that's symbolic instead of numeric). Any royalties I get will go towards my schooling, so if you are looking for a nice Sudoku book with wide margins, please take a look!

So I turned to the hints hoping they could help me out, but it only left me more confused as I couldn't see what it tried to get at.

[A screenshot of the puzzle with the hint](https://imgur.com/a/IexHtzF). The hint implies that because of clues #5 and #6 (I assume it's a typo there), the 13 clue in C8 can't be 3/4/6, but in my eyes, it still could be.  
Clue #5 says that the 10 clue in R5 has to be 2/3/5, which I also found, and clue #6 says that the 14 clue in C7 has to be 2/3/4/5, which, again, I also found.

Now, it says that because ot those two clues, the 13 clue in R8 must contain a 2, since it cannot be 3/4/6, but It still could be. From what I've found, R8C6 has to be either 2 or 6, so the 13 clue could still be 6/3/4 or 6/4/3 and it would still fit. Is there something I'm not seeing?"
52,sudoku,Explain 'hidden triplets' to me.,"I don't understand the logic behind them. Just so we know, here's the site I've been using to figure out this puzzle:

[https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm)

And here's the code for the puzzle I'm trying to solve:

780040912214000365003020070020004609300009207007082501172000056450200193039000720

Now, its telling me that there's a 'hidden triple' in b4, j4, and g4. However, I don't understand this logic. Any configuration of these is possible, long with all the other possibilities in the cells. Each box still remains solvable, no matter which configuration of numbers is used in column 4. I don't get how this can be isolated out. From what it looks like to me, there's two triples in that column! There's also a 1-5-6 triple that appears to be occuring. So why does the 4-8-9 get counted, but the 1-5-6 does not? I just can't figure out how that narrows down anything in this instance. God this puzzle is frustrating me, and this stupid windows sudoku thing throws them at me over half the time if I select the master difficulty. The next difficulty down btw is effortless to me; I can solve expert levels in under 3 minutes without even really trying. I'm starting to think this program just sucks and I need to uninstall it."

54,sudoku,I got lucky :/,
55,sudoku,How do you solve puzzles when there isn't one answer that's obvious?,"I've been playing some sudoku game available on windows for free (I 'bought' it through their store). Honestly, this version is annoying. The expert level is too easy for me (I can easily solve those in 3 or 4 minutes, my record is 2 minutes something). However, the next level, 'master', is too difficult. Very often I end up with a board that I can't find an answer to, even after analyzing it for an hour (my game has an in-game clock). I tried to look up a guide online, but all I found was a list of techniques I already use. Filling out boxes, filling out rows and columns, the standard stuff. For master, I ended up developing a new technique where I see if two numbers have to go in a specific box. Essentially, I try to find a pair of adjacent spaces in the same box where 'if box 1 is x, then box 2 has to be y and vice-versa', I then use that to eliminate those numbers numbers from the rest of the row/column. Of course, it takes me quite a while to find those, and often times I can't find any at all.

Just for an example, here's a master board I have right now that I can't solve. Here's what it originally looked like:

7 9 x x 4 x 9 1 x

2 1 x x x x x x 5

x x x x x 4 6 x 9

3 x x x x 9 x x x

x x x x 8 2 x x 1

1 7 2 x x x x 5 6

x 5 x x x x 1 9 x

x x 9 x x x 7 x x 

Now, here's the farthest I've managed to solve it:

7 9 x x 4 x 9 1 2

2 1 4 x x x 3 6 5

x 2 x x x 4 6 x 9

3 x x x x 9 2 x 7

x x x x 8 2 5 x 1

1 7 2 x x x x 5 6

4 5 x 2 x x 1 9 3

x 3 9 x x x 7 2 x 

As you can see, none of the rows or columns have a single number they could be, and I can't find any pairs that are exclusive to any box. 

I'm getting sick of being unable to solve such puzzles. Obviously, I need a new technique if I'm going to solve these. Note that this is the first time ever I've asked for help, so sorry for my lack of knowledge on proper terminology (if there is one). I've been doing sudoku puzzles for over a decade now and considered myself quite good at them. This is the first sudoku game I've found where I can't play regularly on the highest difficulty (and master isn't even the highest, its the second highest difficulty, though it seems like there's a ludicrous jump in difficulty between expert and master)."

If you really wan to to master solving Sudoku puzzle Hodoku's Learning Mode is the ticket.  What this feature does is you pick a puzzle solving technique.  Hodoku will then generate and solve a puzzle to the point where using a particular technique is the next thing to do in solving the puzzle.  This way you can practice finding a Skyscraper 10 times in a row until you master finding Skyscrapers in a puzzle.   By concentrating on a single technique at a time you can condense years of puzzle solving experience into a few hours.

I am so high on Hodoku's Learning Mode I would recommend people get some crappy PC just for running Hodoku.  Or use your O/S's PC emulator or something.  If if you love Sudoku and want to improve  your skills I strongly encourage you to get access to this feature.

9,sudoku,Chess Sudoku (A Solution in need of a Puzzle),"/u/hosieryadvocate recommended I post this as an actual post.

I made a sudoku that's a variant of Chess, whereas each number represents a chess figure and cannot be in a place where it's capturable by a piece of the same type. Normal sudoku rules also apply.

Pieces:

* 9 - Queen
* 8 - King
* 7 - Knight
* 6 - Bishop
* 5 - Rook
* 4 - North-facing Pawn
* 3 - East-facing Pawn
* 2 - South-facing Pawn
* 1 - West-facing Pawn

Interestingly enough, with sudoku rules, Bishops act like Queens and Rooks just act like normal sudoku digits. Pawns can only capture in the direction they're facing.

That being said, I made a complete solution, but need some help turning it into a puzzle. Anybody want to take a stab at it?

The solution is as follows:

987654213213987654546213987875342169192876345634591872728135496461729538359468721"

This uses the following variant constraints, in addition to normal sudoku rules:

* Sandwich -
 * Digits around the edge of the grid give sum of numbers between 1-9 in the respective row/column.
 * E.g. a 35 would mean that 1 &amp; 9 go in first &amp; last positions, with 2-8 between them in some order, a 0 would mean 1 &amp; 9 are next to each other.


* Magic Squares (x3)
 * 3 boxes of the grid consist of Magic Squares, meaning that all sets of 3 digits within the box (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) sum to the same value.
 * Suggest watching https://youtu.be/hAyZ9K2EBF0?t=104 If you're not familiar with this rule

I received great feedback and have made major updates to the app based on those. Specifically: I got rid of ads, introduced dark mode and support for Google sign-in. I have made plenty updates to game-play, authentication flow &amp; backend performance.

If you are interested, please give it a go. I would very much appreciate any feedback on the app. I am also looking for other ideas of variations to implement next.

Re-iterating the features of the app:

1. Sudoku Variations: Not just the Classic Sudoku, but also 4 other fun variations to try. I will continue to add more variations as I go.
2. Hints: The app not only let's you solve Sudoku puzzles, but enables you to learn &amp; improve as well. At any point, take a hint and the app shows you the technique which should be applied next. Over a period of time, you learn techniques and become smarter.
3. Daily Contest: The app has a Daily Contest section where you compete with others and improve your rating. Over a period of time, strong players will float towards the top of the Ratings Leaderboard!

17,sudoku,I suck at Sudoku and have begun to cheat. I hate myself for it but can't stop,"So I made a post [a month or so ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/sudoku/comments/g5992s/i_suck_at_sudoku_and_its_pissing_me_off/) that I suck at this game.

There were several helpful suggestions, but in all honesty, it was too overwhelming.  I couldn't understand the tips being suggested (granted I dind't spend too much time, just saw that I couldn't grasp an intuitive understanding and gave up after 30 or so seconds).

So i just went on playing Sudoku, and at times getting frustrated that Expert was too easy (there's one variant of the puzzle that pops up that I hate becuase it shouldn't be on expert. I can solve it under 4 minutes), or when Expert is too freaking hard.

I have gotten a little better, and by that I think I mean a little more thorough.  I'm better at going through a lot of cells, and when that ""eureka"" moment happens, I really like it.  I

However lately, I don't know what prompted it, but I've begun ""cheating.""  When I have the grid filled out with various possibilities, I start guessing and checking.  Let's assume this cell is a 4 instead of a 7, then this should be a 5, then this should be a 6...but look it can't be a 6.  Therefore that first cell couldn't have been a 4 and is a 7.

This process is at times super tedious, but when I get stuck this is what I start doing and I can't stop.  There is no eureka moment solving a puzzle this way, and I don't get the same level of satisfaction.  But I can't stop.

On the plus side, I can now solve 100% of the puzzles I come across.  

I try to justify my cheating by saying that I""m doing it entirely in my head...but aht really isn't a staisfactory resonse.

Anyhoo, just venting."

I wanted to create something where you can create, play, and share sudoku puzzles. And not just classic -- it currently **also supports killer and thermo sudoku**. Let me know what rule types you'd like to see next.

The builder is pretty basic right now, but I have plans to turn it from a simple puzzle importer/validator to something that can actually assist you in building the puzzle by suggesting additional cells/constraints to create a unique solution. Stay tuned for that.

NOTE: I need to make some improvements to thermo/killer sudoku solving on the backend. There are some puzzles that currently timeout trying to validate. If you run into such an issue, feel free to reach out at [hello@supradoku.com](mailto:hello@supradoku.com).

It will remember you as an anonymous user but you can later create an account and it will automatically transition all your history to your new profile.

I do keep track of the puzzles you solve and how long it takes you but I'm not displaying that information anywhere yet. Once I actually have some more data I'll start looking into ways to display that information better.

So please give it a try and let me know what you think!"

So much so, that I don't really like solving puzzles anywhere else anymore. After manually entering the NY Times Sudoku into SudokuExchange one too many times, I made a bookmarklet to do it for me.

1. Go to the NY Times Sudoku at https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/ (any difficulty)
2. Bookmark the page
3. In your browser's bookmarks menu, right-click the bookmark and choose Properties
4. Paste this into the location field

```
javascript:(function() { let labels = []; for (cell of document.getElementsByClassName(""su-cell"")) { if (cell.classList.contains(""prefilled"")) { labels.push(parseInt(cell.getAttribute(""aria-label""))); } else { labels.push(0); } } let text = ""https://sudokuexchange.com/play/?s="" + labels.join(""""); window.open(text); }());
```

When you click it, you'll probably have to allow pop-up windows manually. All this does is grab the contents of each cell and construct a URL to a pre-filled puzzle on SudokuExchange, then take you there.
